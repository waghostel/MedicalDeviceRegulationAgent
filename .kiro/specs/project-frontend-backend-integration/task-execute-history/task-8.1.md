    - Confirmed auto-seeding behavior matches environment settings
    - Validated error handling for missing configuration files
    - Result: ✔ Works as expected

- **Code Snippets**: Key implementation highlights

### Environment-Specific Configuration System

```python
class SeederConfig:
    """Configuration for database seeding operations"""
    environment: Environment
    auto_seed_on_startup: bool = False
    clear_before_seed: bool = False
    seed_minimal_data: bool = False
    config_file_path: Optional[str] = None
    validate_before_seed: bool = True
    validate_after_seed: bool = True
    fail_on_validation_error: bool = True
```

### Integrated Seeder Manager

```python
class IntegratedSeederManager:
    """
    Integrated seeder manager that handles environment-specific configuration,
    validation, and error reporting for database seeding operations.
    """
    
    async def seed_database(self, force: bool = False) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Pre-seeding validation
        if self.config.validate_before_seed:
            validation_report = await self.validate_configuration()
            
        # Perform seeding with environment-appropriate settings
        seeder = self._get_seeder()
        await seeder.seed_all(clear_existing=self.config.clear_before_seed)
        
        # Post-seeding validation
        if self.config.validate_after_seed:
            post_validation = self.validator.validate_seeded_data(db_manager)
```

### Application Startup Integration

```python
# Auto-seed database if configured
seeder_config = get_seeder_config()
seeding_results = await auto_seed_on_startup()
if seeding_results:
    if seeding_results["success"]:
        print("[OK] Database auto-seeding completed successfully")
    else:
        print("[WARNING] Database auto-seeding failed")
```

### Environment Configuration Files

- `.env.development`: Development environment with auto-seeding enabled
- `.env.testing`: Testing environment with minimal data and clearing enabled
- `.env.production`: Production environment with auto-seeding disabled and strict validation

## Implementation Details

### 1. Environment-Specific Configuration Management

Created `database/seeder_config.py` with:

- Automatic environment detection from `ENVIRONMENT` or `NODE_ENV` variables
- Environment-specific default configurations (development, testing, production)
- Configuration override capabilities for specific operations
- Fallback configuration paths for different environments

### 2. Seeder Validation System

Implemented `database/seeder_validation.py` with:

- JSON schema validation for configuration files
- Business logic validation (user references, project relationships)
- Data consistency checks (matching product codes, etc.)
- Comprehensive error reporting with actionable suggestions

### 3. Integrated Seeder Manager

Developed `database/integrated_seeder.py` with:

- Environment-aware seeding operations
- Pre and post-seeding validation
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Convenience functions for different environments
- Status reporting and logging

### 4. Application Startup Integration

Updated `main.py` to include:

- Automatic seeder configuration detection
- Conditional auto-seeding based on environment
- Graceful error handling for seeding failures
- Environment-specific behavior (strict in production, lenient in development)

### 5. Enhanced CLI Interface

Improved `seed_database.py` with:

- Environment override options (`--environment`)
- Validation-only mode (`--validate-only`)
- Comprehensive error reporting
- Integration with the new seeder system

### 6. Environment Configuration Files

Created environment-specific configuration:

- Development: Auto-seeding enabled, comprehensive data, validation warnings only
- Testing: Manual seeding, minimal data, clear before seed, strict validation
- Production: No auto-seeding, minimal data only, strict validation, no clearing

## Validation and Error Reporting

The system includes comprehensive validation at multiple levels:

1. **Configuration File Validation**: JSON schema validation with detailed error messages
2. **Business Logic Validation**: Referential integrity checks and consistency validation
3. **Environment Safety**: Production environment protections against data clearing
4. **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of missing files and configuration errors
5. **Actionable Feedback**: Specific suggestions for fixing validation errors

## Environment-Specific Behavior

- **Development**: Auto-seeding enabled, comprehensive data, lenient error handling
- **Testing**: Manual control, minimal data, strict validation, clean slate approach
- **Production**: No auto-seeding, minimal essential data only, strict validation, safety protections

The integrated seeder system successfully provides environment-appropriate database initialization while maintaining data integrity and providing comprehensive error reporting and validation capabilities.
