# Project Frontend-Backend Integration - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for fully connecting the project management features from the frontend to the backend database in the Medical Device Regulatory Assistant. Based on the frontend investigation analysis, the goal is to implement complete CRUD operations for projects, ensure proper data seeding, and create tools for mock data management. This will enable users to create, edit, browse, and manage projects through the current UI while ensuring all data is properly persisted in the database.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Project CRUD Operations

**User Story:** As a regulatory affairs manager, I want to create, read, update, and delete projects through the web interface, so that I can manage my medical device regulatory projects with full data persistence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click "New Project" on the projects page THEN the system SHALL create a new project in the database and redirect me to the project details page
2. WHEN I fill out the project creation form THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields (name, description, device_type, intended_use) and save to the database
3. WHEN I view the projects list THEN the system SHALL display all my projects from the database with proper pagination and search functionality
4. WHEN I edit a project THEN the system SHALL update the database record and reflect changes immediately in the UI
5. WHEN I delete a project THEN the system SHALL remove it from the database and update the UI without requiring a page refresh
6. WHEN I search or filter projects THEN the system SHALL query the database and return matching results in real-time

### Requirement 2: Database Schema and Model Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the database schema to properly support all project features with appropriate relationships and constraints, so that data integrity is maintained across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN projects are stored THEN the database SHALL use the existing SQLAlchemy models with proper field validation
2. WHEN project relationships exist THEN the system SHALL properly link projects to users, device classifications, predicate devices, and agent interactions
3. WHEN data is inserted THEN the system SHALL enforce required field constraints and data type validation
4. WHEN timestamps are needed THEN the system SHALL automatically set created_at and updated_at fields
5. WHEN foreign key relationships exist THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity and handle cascading deletes appropriately

### Requirement 3: API Endpoint Implementation and Testing

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want reliable API endpoints for all project operations, so that the UI can interact with the backend consistently and handle errors gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend calls POST /api/projects THEN the backend SHALL create a new project and return the created project data
2. WHEN the frontend calls GET /api/projects THEN the backend SHALL return paginated project lists with search and filter capabilities
3. WHEN the frontend calls GET /api/projects/{id} THEN the backend SHALL return detailed project information including related data
4. WHEN the frontend calls PUT /api/projects/{id} THEN the backend SHALL update the project and return the updated data
5. WHEN the frontend calls DELETE /api/projects/{id} THEN the backend SHALL delete the project and return confirmation
6. WHEN API errors occur THEN the backend SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes with detailed error messages
7. WHEN authentication is required THEN the backend SHALL validate JWT tokens and enforce user-specific data access

### Requirement 4: Mock Data Seeding and Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive mock data in the database that represents realistic project scenarios, so that I can test the application with meaningful data and demonstrate features effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database is seeded THEN the system SHALL populate projects with realistic medical device data including various device types and regulatory statuses
2. WHEN mock data is created THEN the system SHALL include related data such as device classifications, predicate devices, and agent interactions
3. WHEN seeding runs THEN the system SHALL create data that covers different user scenarios and edge cases
4. WHEN the frontend loads THEN the system SHALL display the seeded mock data properly formatted in all UI components
5. WHEN mock data is updated THEN the system SHALL provide tools to refresh or modify the seed data without losing existing user data

### Requirement 5: JSON-Based Mock Data Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure mock data through JSON files that can be easily modified and version controlled, so that I can customize test data scenarios and maintain consistency across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mock data is needed THEN the system SHALL provide a Python script that reads JSON configuration files
2. WHEN JSON data is provided THEN the script SHALL validate the structure and create appropriate database records
3. WHEN running the seeder THEN the system SHALL support both full database reset and incremental data addition
4. WHEN JSON structure is defined THEN the system SHALL include sample files demonstrating proper format for projects, users, and related entities
5. WHEN data is imported THEN the system SHALL handle relationships correctly and maintain referential integrity

### Requirement 6: Frontend State Management and Real-time Updates

**User Story:** As a user, I want the project interface to respond immediately to my actions and stay synchronized with the database, so that I have a smooth and responsive experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I perform project operations THEN the frontend SHALL use optimistic updates to provide immediate feedback
2. WHEN database operations complete THEN the frontend SHALL synchronize with the actual database state
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the frontend SHALL revert optimistic updates and display appropriate error messages
4. WHEN multiple users access the same project THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent updates gracefully
5. WHEN real-time updates are needed THEN the system SHALL use WebSocket connections to push changes to connected clients

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when operations succeed or fail, so that I understand the current state of my projects and can take appropriate action when problems occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN operations succeed THEN the system SHALL display success notifications with relevant details
2. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL highlight problematic fields and provide clear error messages
3. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL display appropriate messages and provide retry options
4. WHEN database errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information while showing user-friendly messages
5. WHEN operations are in progress THEN the system SHALL display loading states and progress indicators

### Requirement 8: Data Export and Backup Capabilities

**User Story:** As a regulatory affairs manager, I want to export my project data for backup and compliance purposes, so that I can maintain records and share information with stakeholders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request project export THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive reports including all project data and related information
2. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL include audit trails, agent interactions, and document references
3. WHEN export formats are needed THEN the system SHALL support JSON, PDF, and CSV formats
4. WHEN bulk operations are required THEN the system SHALL provide tools to export multiple projects simultaneously
5. WHEN data integrity is critical THEN the system SHALL include checksums and validation information in exports

### Requirement 9: Performance Optimization and Caching

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast response times when browsing and managing projects, so that I can work efficiently without waiting for slow database operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading project lists THEN the system SHALL implement efficient pagination and lazy loading
2. WHEN frequently accessed data is needed THEN the system SHALL use appropriate caching strategies
3. WHEN database queries are complex THEN the system SHALL optimize queries and use proper indexing
4. WHEN real-time updates occur THEN the system SHALL minimize database load and network traffic
5. WHEN performance monitoring is needed THEN the system SHALL provide metrics and logging for optimization

### Requirement 10: Integration Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests that validate the complete frontend-to-database workflow, so that I can ensure reliability and catch regressions early.

#### Acceptance Criteria
