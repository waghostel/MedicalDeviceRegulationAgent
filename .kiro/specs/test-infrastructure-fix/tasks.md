# Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan divides the test infrastructure fixes into independent, parallelizable tasks. The tasks are organized to allow execution on two computers simultaneously while maintaining clear dependencies and integration points.

## Task Distribution Strategy

- **Computer A (Infrastructure & Core)**: Focus on React 19 compatibility and core infrastructure
- **Computer B (Mocks & Components)**: Focus on hook mocks and component-specific fixes
- **Integration Points**: Clearly defined handoff points for combining work

## Development Rules

- Use **`pnpm`** instead of npm for JavaScript/TypeScript.
- Use **`poetry`** for Python commands (e.g. `poetry run python test_document_tool.py`).
- Create the test script and run it instead of run it directly with `poetry run python -c`
- Follow **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**.
- Always clear the terminal before running a new command. Type the clear command first, press Enter, then type the actual command and press Enter again.
- Document the faild and skipped test in the from chat history into **Undone tests/Skipped test**.

Example 1(Windows):

```bash
cls
<command>
```

Example 2 (Mac and Linux)

```bash
clear
<command>
```

- After reading this file, say: **"I will use poetry and pnpm"**.

## Workflow

1. Create a code-writing plan for the task.
2. Define the testing criteria.
3. Fetch related documentation (context7) if needed.
4. Implement the task/code.
5. Run tests after completing the task.
   - If tests fail, fetch additional documentation (context7).
6. Write a **task report** in `./.kiro/specs/[your-spec-name]/task-execute-history/` (e.g. `task-1.1.md`).
   - Be transparent about test results, especially if some tests require future verification.
   - If the test script has been modified, skipped in the developemnt process or skipped chat history, document faild and skipped test in **Undone tests/Skipped test**.
7. Check previous chat history and verify whether any tests were passed, simplified, or skipped during development. Ensure all are documented following our task report format. Provide the exact test command for each test, starting from the root of the codebase.

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

### Testing Guidelines

1. **Pre-Development**
   - Clearly define the **expected test outcomes** before coding begins.
2. **Post-Development**

   - Document **all test results** in:

     ```shell
     ./.kiro/specs/[your-spec-name]/task-execute-history/
     ```

   - This ensures full **traceability** of test executions.

3. **Failed Tests**
   - **Definition**: Tests that did not pass in the latest test run.
   - **Action**: Record the test name, the failure reason, and provide a reference to the related test report.
4. **Skipped and Simplified Tests**
   - **Definition**: Tests that are skipped or simplified because the problem is either too complex or outside the current project scope.
   - **Action**: Identify them from the development process or chat history, and clearly document the reason for skipping.

### Task Report Format

Each completed task requires a report:

## Parallel Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: Independent Development (Parallel)

**Duration**: 2-3 days

- **Computer A**: Execute Tasks A1, A2, A3 independently
- **Computer B**: Execute Tasks B1, B2, B3 independently
- **Communication**: Daily sync on progress and any blocking issues

### Phase 2: Parallel Integration (Parallel)

**Duration**: 1-2 days

- **Computer A**: Execute A-I1, A-I2, A-I3 (infrastructure integration)
- **Computer B**: Execute B-I1, B-I2, B-I3 (mock system integration)
- **Communication**: Hourly sync on interface compatibility

### Phase 3: Joint Integration (Collaborative + Parallel)

**Duration**: 1 day

- **J-I1**: Both computers collaborate for 2-3 hours on system merge
- **J-I2**: Parallel test execution (Computer A: tests 1-21, Computer B: tests 22-42)
- **J-I3**: Parallel final validation (Computer A: performance, Computer B: components)

### Parallel Integration Strategy

#### Phase 2: Independent Integration Testing

- **Computer A**: Tests infrastructure with simple/existing mocks
- **Computer B**: Tests mocks with basic/existing infrastructure
- **Interface Definition**: Both computers work from shared interface contracts
- **Validation**: Each computer validates their system independently first

#### Phase 3: Joint Integration Points

- **J-I1 (System Merge)**: 2-3 hour collaborative session to merge systems
- **J-I2 (Parallel Testing)**: Split test execution to run simultaneously
- **J-I3 (Parallel Validation)**: Each computer focuses on their expertise area

#### Interface Contracts (Defined Upfront)

```typescript
// Mock Loading Interface (Computer A ← Computer B)
interface MockLoader {
  loadHookMocks(): HookMockRegistry;
  loadComponentMocks(): ComponentMockRegistry;
  validateMockStructure(mockName: string): boolean;
}

// Infrastructure Interface (Computer B ← Computer A)
interface TestInfrastructure {
  renderWithProviders(ui: ReactElement, options?: RenderOptions): RenderResult;
  handleReact19Errors(error: AggregateError): void;
  monitorPerformance(): PerformanceMetrics;
}
```

#### Dependency Resolution Strategy

- **Shared Interface File**: Both computers implement against same TypeScript interfaces
- **Mock Data**: Use shared mock data files for consistent testing
- **Integration Branch**: Merge work into shared integration branch for J-I1

### Communication Protocol

#### Communication Schedule

**Phase 1 (Independent Development)**:

1. **Morning Standup** (15 min): Share progress, identify blockers
2. **Midday Interface Check** (10 min): Validate interface compatibility
3. **Evening Review** (20 min): Demonstrate progress, plan integration

**Phase 2 (Parallel Integration)**:

1. **Hourly Check-ins** (5 min): Quick status updates on integration progress
2. **Interface Validation** (30 min, twice daily): Test interface compatibility
3. **Problem Resolution** (as needed): Immediate communication for blocking issues

**Phase 3 (Joint Integration)**:

1. **J-I1 Collaboration Session** (2-3 hours): Real-time collaboration on system merge
2. **J-I2 Parallel Execution** (hourly updates): Coordinate test execution progress
3. **J-I3 Final Validation** (continuous): Share results and coordinate final validation

## How to Run Integration in Parallel

### Step-by-Step Parallel Integration Process

#### Phase 2: Parallel Integration (1-2 days)

**Computer A Tasks (Infrastructure Integration)**:

```bash
# 1. Test infrastructure with existing simple mocks
npm test src/components/loading/__tests__/enhanced-loading-simple.unit.test.tsx

# 2. Validate React 19 compatibility
npm test src/__tests__/infrastructure/react19-compatibility.test.tsx

# 3. Test performance monitoring
npm test src/__tests__/infrastructure/performance-monitoring.test.tsx
```

**Computer B Tasks (Mock Integration)**:

```bash
# 1. Test mocks with basic infrastructure
npm test src/__tests__/mocks/hook-mock-validation.test.tsx

# 2. Validate component mocks
npm test src/__tests__/mocks/component-mock-integration.test.tsx

# 3. Test provider system
npm test src/__tests__/mocks/provider-mock-system.test.tsx
```

#### Phase 3: Joint Integration (1 day)

**J-I1: System Merge (2-3 hours collaborative)**:

```bash
# Both computers work together via VS Code Live Share
git checkout feature/integration-merge
git merge feature/infrastructure-fix-computer-a
git merge feature/mock-system-fix-computer-b
# Resolve conflicts and test basic integration
npm test src/__tests__/integration/basic-system-integration.test.tsx
```

**J-I2: Parallel Test Execution**:

```bash
# Computer A: Run tests 1-21 + integration tests 1-9
npm test src/__tests__/unit/components/ProjectForm.unit.test.tsx --testNamePattern="(renders|populates|validation|submission|loading)"
npm test src/__tests__/integration/enhanced-form-workflow.integration.test.tsx --testNamePattern="(lifecycle|validation|auto-save)"

# Computer B: Run tests 22-42 + integration tests 10-18
npm test src/__tests__/unit/components/ProjectForm.unit.test.tsx --testNamePattern="(error|success|dialog|device|accessibility)"
npm test src/__tests__/integration/enhanced-form-workflow.integration.test.tsx --testNamePattern="(accessibility|performance|cross-browser)"
```

**J-I3: Parallel Final Validation**:

```bash
# Computer A: Performance and CI/CD
npm run test:performance
npm run test:ci-validation
npm run lighthouse

# Computer B: Component and mock validation
npm run test:components
npm run test:accessibility
npm run test:mock-validation
```

### Integration Monitoring Dashboard

Both computers can monitor integration progress in real-time:

```bash
# Shared test results monitoring
npm run test:watch --coverage --verbose
# Results automatically shared via GitHub Actions or shared test runner
```

This parallel integration approach allows both computers to continue working independently while ensuring proper system integration and validation.
