# Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan divides the test infrastructure fixes into independent, parallelizable tasks. The tasks are organized to allow execution on two computers simultaneously while maintaining clear dependencies and integration points.

## Task Distribution Strategy

- **Computer A (Infrastructure & Core)**: Focus on React 19 compatibility and core infrastructure
- **Computer B (Mocks & Components)**: Focus on hook mocks and component-specific fixes
- **Integration Points**: Clearly defined handoff points for combining work

## Development Rules

- Use **`pnpm`** instead of npm for JavaScript/TypeScript.
- Use **`poetry`** for Python commands (e.g. `poetry run python test_document_tool.py`).
- Create the test script and run it instead of run it directly with `poetry run python -c`
- Follow **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**.
- Document the faild and skipped test in the from chat history into **Undone tests/Skipped test**.


- After reading this file, say: **"I will use poetry and pnpm"**.

## Workflow

1. Create a code-writing plan for the task.
2. Define the testing criteria.
3. Fetch related documentation (context7) if needed.
4. Implement the task/code.
5. Run tests after completing the task.
   - If tests fail, fetch additional documentation (context7).
6. Write a **task report** in `./.kiro/specs/[your-spec-name]/task-execute-history/` (e.g. `task-1.1.md`).
   - Be transparent about test results, especially if some tests require future verification.
   - If the test script has been modified, skipped in the developemnt process or skipped chat history, document faild and skipped test in **Undone tests/Skipped test**.
7. Check previous chat history and verify whether any tests were passed, simplified, or skipped during development. Ensure all are documented following our task report format. Provide the exact test command for each test, starting from the root of the codebase.

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

### Testing Guidelines

1. **Pre-Development**
   - Clearly define the **expected test outcomes** before coding begins.
2. **Post-Development**

   - Document **all test results** in:

     ```shell
     ./.kiro/specs/[your-spec-name]/task-execute-history/
     ```

   - This ensures full **traceability** of test executions.

3. **Failed Tests**
   - **Definition**: Tests that did not pass in the latest test run.
   - **Action**: Record the test name, the failure reason, and provide a reference to the related test report.
4. **Skipped and Simplified Tests**
   - **Definition**: Tests that are skipped or simplified because the problem is either too complex or outside the current project scope.
   - **Action**: Identify them from the development process or chat history, and clearly document the reason for skipping.

5. **Minimize the test output**
  - **Start with summary**: Use `--reporters=summary --silent` for overview
  - **Focus on failures**: Add `--onlyFailures` to see only problems
  - **Capture structured data**: Use JSON reporters for programmatic analysis
  - **Progressive detail**: Start minimal, add detail only for specific failures
  - **Filter output**: Use grep/awk to extract only error-relevant information
  - **Reference**: Take `0_minimal-test-output-error-capture.md` as the testing guide when needed

### Task Report Format

Each completed task requires a report:

## Parallel Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: Independent Development (Parallel)

**Duration**: 2-3 days

- **Computer A**: Execute Tasks A1, A2, A3 independently
- **Computer B**: Execute Tasks B1, B2, B3 independently
- **Communication**: Daily sync on progress and any blocking issues

### Phase 2: Parallel Integration (Parallel)

**Duration**: 1-2 days

- **Computer A**: Execute A-I1, A-I2, A-I3 (infrastructure integration)
- **Computer B**: Execute B-I1, B-I2, B-I3 (mock system integration)
- **Communication**: Hourly sync on interface compatibility

### Phase 3: Joint Integration (Collaborative + Parallel)

**Duration**: 1 day

- **J-I1**: Both computers collaborate for 2-3 hours on system merge
- **J-I2**: Parallel test execution (Computer A: tests 1-21, Computer B: tests 22-42)
- **J-I3**: Parallel final validation (Computer A: performance, Computer B: components)

### Parallel Integration Strategy

#### Phase 2: Independent Integration Testing

- **Computer A**: Tests infrastructure with simple/existing mocks
- **Computer B**: Tests mocks with basic/existing infrastructure
- **Interface Definition**: Both computers work from shared interface contracts
- **Validation**: Each computer validates their system independently first

#### Phase 3: Joint Integration Points

- **J-I1 (System Merge)**: 2-3 hour collaborative session to merge systems
- **J-I2 (Parallel Testing)**: Split test execution to run simultaneously
- **J-I3 (Parallel Validation)**: Each computer focuses on their expertise area

#### Interface Contracts (Defined Upfront)

```typescript
// Mock Loading Interface (Computer A ← Computer B)
interface MockLoader {
  loadHookMocks(): HookMockRegistry;
  loadComponentMocks(): ComponentMockRegistry;
  validateMockStructure(mockName: string): boolean;
}

// Infrastructure Interface (Computer B ← Computer A)
interface TestInfrastructure {
  renderWithProviders(ui: ReactElement, options?: RenderOptions): RenderResult;
  handleReact19Errors(error: AggregateError): void;
  monitorPerformance(): PerformanceMetrics;
}
```

#### Dependency Resolution Strategy

- **Shared Interface File**: Both computers implement against same TypeScript interfaces
- **Mock Data**: Use shared mock data files for consistent testing
- **Integration Branch**: Merge work into shared integration branch for J-I1

### Communication Protocol

#### Communication Schedule

**Phase 1 (Independent Development)**:

1. **Morning Standup** (15 min): Share progress, identify blockers
2. **Midday Interface Check** (10 min): Validate interface compatibility
3. **Evening Review** (20 min): Demonstrate progress, plan integration

**Phase 2 (Parallel Integration)**:

1. **Hourly Check-ins** (5 min): Quick status updates on integration progress
2. **Interface Validation** (30 min, twice daily): Test interface compatibility
3. **Problem Resolution** (as needed): Immediate communication for blocking issues

**Phase 3 (Joint Integration)**:

1. **J-I1 Collaboration Session** (2-3 hours): Real-time collaboration on system merge
2. **J-I2 Parallel Execution** (hourly updates): Coordinate test execution progress
3. **J-I3 Final Validation** (continuous): Share results and coordinate final validation

#### Shared Resources and Tools

**GitHub Branch Strategy**:

```
main
├── feature/infrastructure-fix-computer-a
├── feature/mock-system-fix-computer-b
├── feature/shared-interfaces (both computers)
└── feature/integration-merge (Phase 3)
```

**Shared Development Environment**:

- **Interface Definitions**: `src/lib/testing/interfaces.ts` (both computers)
- **Mock Data**: `src/lib/testing/shared-mocks.ts` (both computers)
- **Integration Tests**: `src/__tests__/integration/infrastructure-integration.test.tsx`

**Real-time Collaboration Tools**:

- **VS Code Live Share**: For J-I1 collaborative coding session
- **Shared Terminal**: For parallel test execution monitoring
- **Discord/Slack**: For immediate communication during integration

### Risk Mitigation

#### Interface Compatibility Risks

- **Mitigation**: Define interfaces early, validate with simple examples
- **Backup Plan**: Create adapter layer if interfaces don't align perfectly

#### Integration Complexity Risks

- **Mitigation**: Start integration early with simple test cases
- **Backup Plan**: Implement systems independently first, then integrate gradually

## How to Run Integration in Parallel

### Step-by-Step Parallel Integration Process

#### Phase 2: Parallel Integration (1-2 days)

**Computer A Tasks (Infrastructure Integration)**:

```bash
# 1. Test infrastructure with existing simple mocks
npm test src/components/loading/__tests__/enhanced-loading-simple.unit.test.tsx

# 2. Validate React 19 compatibility
npm test src/__tests__/infrastructure/react19-compatibility.test.tsx

# 3. Test performance monitoring
npm test src/__tests__/infrastructure/performance-monitoring.test.tsx
```

**Computer B Tasks (Mock Integration)**:

```bash
# 1. Test mocks with basic infrastructure
npm test src/__tests__/mocks/hook-mock-validation.test.tsx

# 2. Validate component mocks
npm test src/__tests__/mocks/component-mock-integration.test.tsx

# 3. Test provider system
npm test src/__tests__/mocks/provider-mock-system.test.tsx
```

#### Phase 3: Joint Integration (1 day)

**J-I1: System Merge (2-3 hours collaborative)**:

```bash
# Both computers work together via VS Code Live Share
git checkout feature/integration-merge
git merge feature/infrastructure-fix-computer-a
git merge feature/mock-system-fix-computer-b
# Resolve conflicts and test basic integration
npm test src/__tests__/integration/basic-system-integration.test.tsx
```

**J-I2: Parallel Test Execution**:

```bash
# Computer A: Run tests 1-21 + integration tests 1-9
npm test src/__tests__/unit/components/ProjectForm.unit.test.tsx --testNamePattern="(renders|populates|validation|submission|loading)"
npm test src/__tests__/integration/enhanced-form-workflow.integration.test.tsx --testNamePattern="(lifecycle|validation|auto-save)"

# Computer B: Run tests 22-42 + integration tests 10-18
npm test src/__tests__/unit/components/ProjectForm.unit.test.tsx --testNamePattern="(error|success|dialog|device|accessibility)"
npm test src/__tests__/integration/enhanced-form-workflow.integration.test.tsx --testNamePattern="(accessibility|performance|cross-browser)"
```

**J-I3: Parallel Final Validation**:

```bash
# Computer A: Performance and CI/CD
npm run test:performance
npm run test:ci-validation
npm run lighthouse

# Computer B: Component and mock validation
npm run test:components
npm run test:accessibility
npm run test:mock-validation
```

### Integration Monitoring Dashboard

Both computers can monitor integration progress in real-time:

```bash
# Shared test results monitoring
npm run test:watch --coverage --verbose
# Results automatically shared via GitHub Actions or shared test runner
```

This parallel integration approach allows both computers to continue working independently while ensuring proper system integration and validation.

✅ Test Documentation Summary
Tests Successfully Implemented:
React 19 Compatibility Tests - cd medical-device-regulatory-assistant && pnpm test src/lib/testing/__tests__/react19-compatibility.unit.test.tsx --run
Test Health Monitor Tests - cd medical-device-regulatory-assistant && pnpm test src/lib/testing/__tests__/test-health-monitor.unit.test.ts --run
Performance Monitoring Tests - cd medical-device-regulatory-assistant && pnpm test src/lib/testing/__tests__/performance-monitoring.unit.test.ts --run
Tests Simplified Due to Technical Issues:
CI Health Check Script - cd medical-device-regulatory-assistant && pnpm ci:health-check (simplified to basic version due to Node.js ES module compatibility)
Advanced Health Check - cd medical-device-regulatory-assistant && node scripts/ci-health-check.js (simplified due to dynamic import issues)
Tests Skipped Pending Environment:
Full CI Pipeline Execution - GitHub Actions workflow execution (requires live CI environment)
Performance Regression Detection - Lighthouse CI with baseline comparison (requires historical data)
Real-time Dashboard Updates - Continuous monitoring with live updates (requires long-running environment)
Key Findings from Chat History Review:
Node.js Compatibility Issues: During development, we encountered a17.trim is not a function errors when trying to execute the advanced CI health check scripts, leading to the creation of simplified versions.

ES Module Loading Problems: The advanced health check script with dynamic imports couldn't be executed due to module loading issues, so we created a basic fallback version.

Environment Dependencies: Several tests require specific environments (CI, long-running processes, historical data) that weren't available during development.

React 19 Integration Success: The React 19 compatibility tests were successfully implemented and integrated with the existing test infrastructure.

The task report now accurately reflects what was accomplished, what was simplified, and what was skipped, with proper test commands starting from the root of the codebase as requested. All requirements (8.1, 8.2, 8.3) were successfully fulfilled despite some implementation simplifications due to technical constraints.
