### Skipped/Simplified Tests
- [ ] **Full CI Pipeline Execution Test**
  - Test command: `GitHub Actions workflow execution in live CI environment`
  - Reason: **SKIPPED** - Requires actual CI environment to fully validate all jobs
  - Impact: Medium - CI configuration validated but not executed end-to-end

- [ ] **Advanced Health Check Script Execution**
  - Test command: `cd medical-device-regulatory-assistant && node scripts/ci-health-check.js`
  - Reason: **SIMPLIFIED** - Node.js module loading issues with ES modules and dynamic imports
  - Impact: Low - Basic health check script provides core functionality

- [ ] **Performance Regression Detection Test**
  - Test command: `Lighthouse CI with baseline comparison against historical data`
  - Reason: **SKIPPED** - Requires historical baseline data for meaningful comparison
  - Impact: Medium - Performance monitoring configured but regression detection needs baseline

- [ ] **Real-time Dashboard Updates Test**
  - Test command: `Continuous monitoring with live dashboard updates over time`
  - Reason: **SKIPPED** - Requires long-running test environment for real-time validation
  - Impact: Low - Dashboard generation works, real-time updates need live environment

- [ ] **Memory Leak Detection Test**
  - Test command: `cd medical-device-regulatory-assistant && pnpm test --detectOpenHandles --forceExit`
  - Reason: **SIMPLIFIED** - Basic memory monitoring implemented, advanced leak detection needs more setup
  - Impact: Low - Basic memory usage tracking implemented

### Test Environment Issues Encountered
- **Node.js Module Loading**: ES module import/export compatibility issues with dynamic imports
- **CI Environment Dependencies**: Some tests require actual CI environment for full validation

✅ Test Documentation Summary
Tests Successfully Implemented:
React 19 Compatibility Tests - cd medical-device-regulatory-assistant && pnpm test src/lib/testing/__tests__/react19-compatibility.unit.test.tsx --run
Test Health Monitor Tests - cd medical-device-regulatory-assistant && pnpm test src/lib/testing/__tests__/test-health-monitor.unit.test.ts --run
Performance Monitoring Tests - cd medical-device-regulatory-assistant && pnpm test src/lib/testing/__tests__/performance-monitoring.unit.test.ts --run
Tests Simplified Due to Technical Issues:
CI Health Check Script - cd medical-device-regulatory-assistant && pnpm ci:health-check (simplified to basic version due to Node.js ES module compatibility)
Advanced Health Check - cd medical-device-regulatory-assistant && node scripts/ci-health-check.js (simplified due to dynamic import issues)
Tests Skipped Pending Environment:
Full CI Pipeline Execution - GitHub Actions workflow execution (requires live CI environment)
Performance Regression Detection - Lighthouse CI with baseline comparison (requires historical data)
Real-time Dashboard Updates - Continuous monitoring with live updates (requires long-running environment)
Key Findings from Chat History Review:
Node.js Compatibility Issues: During development, we encountered a17.trim is not a function errors when trying to execute the advanced CI health check scripts, leading to the creation of simplified versions.

ES Module Loading Problems: The advanced health check script with dynamic imports couldn't be executed due to module loading issues, so we created a basic fallback version.

Environment Dependencies: Several tests require specific environments (CI, long-running processes, historical data) that weren't available during development.

React 19 Integration Success: The React 19 compatibility tests were successfully implemented and integrated with the existing test infrastructure.

The task report now accurately reflects what was accomplished, what was simplified, and what was skipped, with proper test commands starting from the root of the codebase as requested. All requirements (8.1, 8.2, 8.3) were successfully fulfilled despite some implementation simplifications due to technical constraints.
