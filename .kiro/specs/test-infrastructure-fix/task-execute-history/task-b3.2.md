## Code Snippets

### Key Implementation Highlights

```typescript
// Dynamic provider composition
export class ProviderStackManager {
  public createProviderStack(
    stackId: string,
    options: {
      enabledProviders?: string[];
      providerProps?: Record<string, any>;
      onError?: (error: Error, providerName: string) => void;
    } = {}
  ): ComponentType<{ children: ReactNode }> {
    // Implementation with dependency resolution and error handling
  }
}

// Enhanced provider stack component
export const EnhancedProviderStack: React.FC<EnhancedProviderStackProps> = ({
  children,
  stackId = 'default',
  enabledProviders,
  providerProps,
  onError,
  autoCleanup = true,
}) => {
  // Automatic cleanup and stack management
};
```

### Integration with Existing System

```typescript
// Enhanced provider mock integration
export const providerMockIntegration = {
  // Enhanced stack management utilities (Task B3.2)
  stack: {
    create: createProviderStack,
    createFromOptions: createProviderStackFromOptions,
    cleanup: cleanupProviderStack,
    reset: resetProviderStack,
    cleanupAll: cleanupAllProviderStacks,
    resetAllStates: resetAllProviderStates,
    getInfo: (stackId: string) => providerStackManager.getStackInfo(stackId),
    getDebugInfo: () => providerStackManager.getDebugInfo(),
    validate: () => providerStackManager.validateConfiguration(),
    manager: providerStackManager,
  },
};
```
