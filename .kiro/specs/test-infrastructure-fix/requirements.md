# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical test infrastructure issues identified in the enhanced form system analysis. The current test suite has a 62.5% failure rate (70 failing tests out of 112 total) due to React 19 compatibility issues and hook mock configuration problems. The enhanced form features appear to be correctly implemented but cannot be validated due to infrastructure failures.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: React 19 Test Infrastructure Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the test infrastructure to be compatible with React 19, so that I can run tests for enhanced form components without AggregateError failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running ProjectForm unit tests THEN the system SHALL render components without AggregateError exceptions
2. WHEN using renderWithProviders function THEN the system SHALL handle React 19's error aggregation system correctly
3. WHEN testing complex component trees THEN the system SHALL not fail due to React 19 compatibility issues
4. IF @testing-library/react version is incompatible THEN the system SHALL use a React 19 compatible version
5. WHEN running enhanced form integration tests THEN the system SHALL complete without React rendering errors

### Requirement 2: Hook Mock Configuration Accuracy

**User Story:** As a developer, I want hook mocks to match actual implementations, so that enhanced form components can render successfully in tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN useToast hook is mocked THEN the system SHALL provide the correct function export structure
2. WHEN useEnhancedForm is tested THEN the system SHALL have properly mocked useFormToast dependencies
3. WHEN enhanced form components render THEN the system SHALL not fail with "useToast is not a function" errors
4. IF hook dependency chains exist THEN the system SHALL mock all required dependencies
5. WHEN auto-save functionality is tested THEN the system SHALL provide localStorage and timer mocks

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Form Test Coverage Restoration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all enhanced form tests to pass, so that I can validate the enhanced form system functionality before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running ProjectForm unit tests THEN the system SHALL achieve >95% pass rate (41+ out of 43 tests)
2. WHEN running enhanced form validation tests THEN the system SHALL validate real-time validation, character counting, and whitespace validation
3. WHEN running auto-save functionality tests THEN the system SHALL validate localStorage persistence, data restoration, and cleanup
4. WHEN running enhanced accessibility tests THEN the system SHALL validate ARIA attributes, screen reader support, and keyboard navigation
5. IF enhanced form integration tests are run THEN the system SHALL complete all 18 test scenarios successfully

### Requirement 4: Component-Specific Test Issue Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want component-specific test failures resolved, so that all UI components have reliable test coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running toast component tests THEN the system SHALL resolve multiple element role conflicts
2. WHEN testing toast accessibility THEN the system SHALL provide proper test data attributes and ARIA support
3. WHEN testing toast variants THEN the system SHALL correctly apply and validate CSS classes
4. IF toast components have focus management THEN the system SHALL validate keyboard accessibility correctly
5. WHEN testing custom className application THEN the system SHALL verify proper CSS class inheritance

### Requirement 5: Test Infrastructure Reliability and Performance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable and performant test infrastructure, so that I can run tests efficiently during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the complete test suite THEN the system SHALL complete within 30 seconds
2. WHEN tests are run multiple times THEN the system SHALL produce consistent results
3. WHEN mock configurations are updated THEN the system SHALL not break existing working tests
4. IF test failures occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and debugging information
5. WHEN new enhanced form features are added THEN the system SHALL support testing without infrastructure changes

### Requirement 6: Test Documentation and Maintenance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation for test patterns, so that I can write and maintain tests effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing new enhanced form tests THEN the system SHALL provide documented mock patterns
2. WHEN debugging test failures THEN the system SHALL have troubleshooting guides available
3. WHEN updating React or testing dependencies THEN the system SHALL have compatibility guidelines
4. IF test infrastructure changes THEN the system SHALL update documentation accordingly
5. WHEN onboarding new developers THEN the system SHALL provide clear testing setup instructions

### Requirement 7: Backward Compatibility and Migration Safety

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test infrastructure changes to be backward compatible, so that existing working tests continue to function.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating test infrastructure THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing working tests
2. WHEN fixing React 19 issues THEN the system SHALL not break enhanced loading component tests (22 passing tests)
3. WHEN updating hook mocks THEN the system SHALL preserve functionality for simple component tests
4. IF breaking changes are necessary THEN the system SHALL provide migration guides and gradual adoption paths
5. WHEN deploying test fixes THEN the system SHALL validate that previously passing tests still pass

### Requirement 8: Continuous Integration and Quality Gates

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test infrastructure to support CI/CD pipelines, so that code quality is maintained automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests in CI environment THEN the system SHALL complete successfully with >90% pass rate
2. WHEN pull requests are submitted THEN the system SHALL validate enhanced form functionality automatically
3. WHEN test failures occur in CI THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error reports
4. IF performance regressions are detected THEN the system SHALL fail the build with clear metrics
5. WHEN deploying to production THEN the system SHALL require all enhanced form tests to pass
