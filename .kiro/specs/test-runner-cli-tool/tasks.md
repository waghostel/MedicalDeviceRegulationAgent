# Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to building the Cross-Platform Test Runner CLI Tool. The tasks are organized to enable systematic development with clear testing criteria and comprehensive documentation of progress.

## Development Rules

- Use **Node.js** with **pnpm** or **ppnpm** for JavaScript/TypeScript development
- Follow **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles
- Create test scripts and run them instead of executing commands directly
- Document all failed and skipped tests in task reports
- After reading this file, acknowledge: **"I will follow TDD and document all test results"**

## Workflow

1. Create a code-writing plan for the task
2. Define the testing criteria and expected outcomes
3. Fetch related documentation (Context7) if needed
4. Implement the task/code following TDD principles
5. Run tests after completing the task
   - If tests fail, fetch additional documentation and iterate
6. Write a **task report** in `./.kiro/specs/test-runner-cli-tool/task-execute-history/` (e.g. `task-1.1.md`)
   - Be transparent about test results, especially if some tests require future verification
   - Document any tests that were modified, skipped, or failed during development
7. Check previous chat history and verify whether any tests were passed, simplified, or skipped during development
8. Ensure all test results are documented following the task report format
9. Provide exact test commands for each test, starting from the project root

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

### Testing Guidelines

1. **Pre-Development**
   - Clearly define **expected test outcomes** before coding begins
   - Write failing tests first, then implement code to make them pass

2. **Post-Development**
   - Document **all test results** in: `./.kiro/specs/test-runner-cli-tool/task-execute-history/`
   - This ensures full **traceability** of test executions

3. **Failed Tests**
   - **Definition**: Tests that did not pass in the latest test run
   - **Action**: Record the test name, failure reason, and reference to related test report

4. **Skipped and Simplified Tests**
   - **Definition**: Tests that are skipped or simplified due to complexity or scope limitations
   - **Action**: Document the reason for skipping from development process or chat history

### Task Report Format

Each completed task requires a report following this template:

#### Task Report Template

```markdown
# Task Report: [Task ID and Title]

### Test Command Reference

**Node.js/JavaScript Tests:**
```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run specific test file
pnpm test -- path/to/test.js

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm run test:watch
```

**Cross-Platform Testing:**
```bash
# Test on current platform
pnpm run test:platform

# Test CLI functionality
node src/index.js --help
node src/index.js --version
```

## Task Implementation Guidelines

### Before Starting Each Task:
1. Read the requirements and design documents
2. Understand the acceptance criteria
3. Plan the implementation approach
4. Write failing tests first (TDD)

### During Implementation:
1. Follow the design specifications
2. Implement code to make tests pass
3. Refactor for quality and maintainability
4. Test cross-platform compatibility where applicable

### After Completing Each Task:
1. Run all relevant tests
2. Document results in task report
3. Commit changes with clear messages
4. Update task status to completed
