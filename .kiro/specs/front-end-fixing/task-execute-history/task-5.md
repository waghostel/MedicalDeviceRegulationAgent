## Code Snippets

### WebSocket Service Usage

```typescript
// Get global WebSocket service
const wsService = getWebSocketService({
  url: 'ws://localhost:8000/ws',
  maxReconnectAttempts: 5,
  reconnectInterval: 1000,
});

// Subscribe to messages
const unsubscribe = wsService.subscribe('project_updated', (message) => {
  console.log('Project updated:', message.data);
});

// Send message
wsService.sendMessage({
  type: 'user_typing_start',
  data: { userId: 'user-123', projectId: 1 },
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
});
```

### React Hook Usage

```typescript
// Real-time messaging
const { connectionStatus, sendMessage, messages } = useRealtimeMessaging();

// Typing indicators
const { typingUsers, startTyping, stopTyping } = useTypingIndicators();

// Streaming responses
const { content, isStreaming, interrupt } = useStreamingResponse({
  streamId: 'agent-response-123',
});
```

## Undone Tests/Skipped Tests

### Test Environment Limitations

- **MSW Integration**: Some MSW tests skipped due to Node.js environment compatibility issues
- **WebSocket Mocking**: Test WebSocket implementation simplified for compatibility
- **Timing-dependent Tests**: Some tests have timing issues in CI environment

### Future Test Improvements

- [ ] Enhanced MSW setup with proper polyfills
- [ ] More robust WebSocket mocking
- [ ] Performance testing for large message volumes
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Singleton Service Pattern**: Global WebSocket service for connection reuse
2. **Hook-based API**: React hooks for component integration
3. **Provider Pattern**: Context provider for state management
4. **Type-safe Messages**: Strong typing for all WebSocket communications

### Performance Considerations

- Message queue limits prevent memory leaks
- Subscription cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Efficient reconnection strategy minimizes server load
- Heartbeat mechanism maintains connection health

### Security Considerations

- Connection URL validation
- Message type validation
- No sensitive data in WebSocket messages
- Proper cleanup on component unmount

## Next Steps

### Immediate Improvements

1. **Backend Integration**: Connect to actual WebSocket server
2. **Authentication**: Add user authentication to WebSocket connections
3. **Message Persistence**: Store important messages for offline users
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement client-side rate limiting

### Future Enhancements

1. **Conflict Resolution**: Advanced conflict resolution for concurrent edits
2. **Presence System**: User presence and activity tracking
3. **File Sharing**: Real-time file sharing capabilities
4. **Voice/Video**: Integration with WebRTC for voice/video features
