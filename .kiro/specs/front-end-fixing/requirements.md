# Requirements Document - Frontend Error Resolution and Feature Implementation

## Introduction

This requirements document outlines the comprehensive frontend error resolution and feature implementation needs for the Medical Device Regulatory Assistant application. The system is a specialized AI-powered platform designed to streamline the regulatory process for medical device companies, with an initial focus on the US FDA market and 510(k) predicate search workflows.

The frontend application is built using Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Shadcn UI components, and Tailwind CSS, following modern web development best practices. The application must provide a robust, accessible, and performant user interface that enables regulatory affairs professionals to efficiently navigate complex FDA regulations.
