# Requirements Document - .gitignore Analysis and Optimization

## Introduction

This specification addresses the need to analyze and optimize the .gitignore configuration for the Medical Device Regulatory Assistant project. The project has a complex structure with multiple sub-projects (main application, showcase website, documentation) and uses different technologies (Python/Poetry, Node.js/pnpm, Next.js). A proper .gitignore configuration is essential to prevent sensitive data, build artifacts, and temporary files from being committed to version control.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure that sensitive files like database files, environment variables, and API keys are properly excluded from version control, so that security is maintained and credentials are not exposed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the project structure THEN the system SHALL identify all database files (*.db, *.sqlite, *.sqlite3) that should be ignored
2. WHEN checking environment files THEN the system SHALL ensure .env files are ignored while .env.example files remain tracked
3. WHEN reviewing API keys and credentials THEN the system SHALL verify that no sensitive authentication files are being tracked
4. WHEN examining the current .gitignore THEN the system SHALL identify any sensitive files currently being tracked that should be ignored

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want build artifacts, cache files, and temporary files to be properly ignored, so that the repository remains clean and build processes don't conflict.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing Python projects THEN the system SHALL ensure __pycache__, *.pyc, *.pyo, .pytest_cache, .mypy_cache, and *.egg-info directories are ignored
2. WHEN examining Node.js projects THEN the system SHALL verify node_modules/, dist/, build/, coverage/, .next/, and *.tsbuildinfo files are ignored
3. WHEN checking test artifacts THEN the system SHALL ensure test-reports/, coverage/, and test result files are properly ignored
4. WHEN reviewing build outputs THEN the system SHALL verify that compiled assets and distribution files are excluded

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want IDE and OS-specific files to be ignored appropriately, so that different development environments don't create conflicts in the repository.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking OS files THEN the system SHALL ensure .DS_Store (macOS), Thumbs.db (Windows), and desktop.ini files are ignored
2. WHEN examining IDE files THEN the system SHALL verify that editor-specific files are ignored while allowing essential project configuration
3. WHEN reviewing temporary files THEN the system SHALL ensure *.tmp, *.log, and other temporary files are properly excluded
4. WHEN analyzing the .vscode directory THEN the system SHALL allow settings.json for project configuration while ignoring other VS Code files

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify any files that are currently being ignored but should be tracked, so that important project files are not accidentally excluded.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing ignored patterns THEN the system SHALL identify any essential configuration files that might be incorrectly ignored
2. WHEN checking documentation files THEN the system SHALL ensure that important README, setup guides, and documentation are not being ignored
3. WHEN examining example files THEN the system SHALL verify that .env.example, docker-compose.example, and similar template files are tracked
4. WHEN analyzing project structure THEN the system SHALL identify any source code or configuration files that should be tracked but are currently ignored

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the .gitignore configuration to be optimized for the multi-project structure, so that each sub-project has appropriate ignore rules without conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the root .gitignore THEN the system SHALL ensure it covers global patterns applicable to all sub-projects
2. WHEN examining sub-project .gitignore files THEN the system SHALL verify they complement rather than conflict with the root configuration
3. WHEN checking pattern specificity THEN the system SHALL ensure that ignore patterns are appropriately scoped to avoid over-exclusion
4. WHEN reviewing the medical-device-regulatory-assistant subdirectory THEN the system SHALL verify its .gitignore is properly configured for the Next.js/FastAPI stack
5. WHEN examining the showcase-website subdirectory THEN the system SHALL ensure its .gitignore is appropriate for a Next.js project
