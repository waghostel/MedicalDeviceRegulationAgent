# Backend Health System Fix - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the persistent database connection error in the Medical Device Regulatory Assistant backend health check system. The error "'async_generator' object does not support the asynchronous context manager protocol" indicates a fundamental issue with how async database connections are being managed within the FastAPI application's health check system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Connection Management Fix

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the backend health check to properly connect to the SQLite database without async context manager errors, so that the application can start successfully and report accurate health status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the health check endpoint is called THEN the database connection SHALL be established without async context manager protocol errors
2. WHEN the database health check runs THEN it SHALL properly open and close database connections using correct async patterns
3. WHEN the backend starts up THEN the database initialization SHALL complete without errors
4. WHEN multiple health checks run concurrently THEN the database connections SHALL be managed safely without conflicts
5. WHEN the health check completes THEN it SHALL return accurate database status information

### Requirement 2: Async Context Manager Compliance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all database operations to follow proper async context manager protocols, so that the application handles database connections reliably and prevents resource leaks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database sessions are created THEN they SHALL use proper async context manager syntax (async with)
2. WHEN database operations complete THEN connections SHALL be automatically closed and resources released
3. WHEN errors occur during database operations THEN connections SHALL be properly cleaned up
4. WHEN the application uses SQLite THEN it SHALL use appropriate async SQLite libraries and patterns
5. WHEN database sessions are accessed THEN they SHALL be compatible with FastAPI's dependency injection system

### Requirement 3: Health Check System Reliability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive health checks that accurately report system status, so that I can monitor the application's operational health and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the health check runs THEN it SHALL test database connectivity, Redis connectivity, FDA API accessibility, disk space, and memory usage
2. WHEN any health check component fails THEN it SHALL provide detailed error information and suggested remediation steps
3. WHEN the health check succeeds THEN it SHALL return detailed status information including response times and resource usage
4. WHEN health checks are called frequently THEN they SHALL perform efficiently without impacting application performance
5. WHEN the system is under load THEN health checks SHALL continue to function reliably

### Requirement 4: Database Session Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust database session management system that works correctly with FastAPI and SQLite, so that all database operations are reliable and performant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL initialize the database connection pool correctly
2. WHEN API endpoints need database access THEN they SHALL use dependency injection to get database sessions
3. WHEN database transactions are needed THEN they SHALL be properly managed with commit/rollback functionality
4. WHEN the application shuts down THEN it SHALL gracefully close all database connections
5. WHEN database migrations are needed THEN they SHALL be applied automatically during startup

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Diagnostics

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and diagnostic information for database issues, so that I can quickly identify and resolve problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with detailed context and stack traces
2. WHEN the health check fails THEN it SHALL provide specific error messages and suggested fixes
3. WHEN database connection issues arise THEN they SHALL be reported with connection string and configuration details
4. WHEN async context manager errors occur THEN they SHALL be caught and handled gracefully with fallback behavior
5. WHEN diagnostic tests are run THEN they SHALL verify database schema, connectivity, and performance
