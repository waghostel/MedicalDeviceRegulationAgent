## Code Snippets

### Test Structure Overview
```python
class TestDatabaseManagerIntegration:
    """Comprehensive tests for DatabaseManager initialization, connection management, and cleanup."""

class TestConcurrentDatabaseAccess:
    """Test concurrent database access and connection pooling behavior."""

class TestHealthCheckIntegration:
    """Test health check functionality with both successful and failure scenarios."""

class TestFastAPIDependencyIntegration:
    """Test FastAPI dependency injection with database connections."""

class TestErrorHandlingAndRecovery:
    """Test comprehensive error handling and recovery scenarios."""

class TestIntegrationWithHealthCheckService:
    """Test complete integration with health check service."""
```

### Key Test Patterns
```python
# Concurrent operation testing
async def test_concurrent_read_operations(self, shared_database_manager):
    async def read_worker(worker_id: int) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Perform multiple database operations
        pass
    
    # Run 10 concurrent read workers
    tasks = [read_worker(i) for i in range(10)]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    
    # Verify all workers completed successfully
    assert len(results) == 10

# Error handling testing
async def test_initialization_error_handling(self):
    db_manager = DatabaseManager("sqlite:/invalid/nonexistent/path/database.db")
    
    with pytest.raises((InitializationError, DatabaseError)):
        await db_manager.initialize()
    
    # Test health check after failed initialization
    health_result = await db_manager.health_check()
    assert health_result["healthy"] is False
```

## Requirements Coverage

- **Requirement 1.1**: ✔ Database connection management tested with initialization, cleanup, and error recovery
- **Requirement 1.2**: ✔ Async context manager compliance tested with proper connection handling
- **Requirement 1.3**: ✔ Health check system reliability tested with success/failure scenarios and performance monitoring
- **Requirement 1.4**: ✔ Database session management tested with FastAPI dependency injection
- **Requirement 1.5**: ✔ Error handling and diagnostics tested with comprehensive error scenarios and recovery mechanisms

## Test Execution Summary

- **Total Tests**: 28 test cases
- **Test Result**: ✔ All tests passed
- **Execution Time**: ~5.6 seconds
- **Coverage Areas**:
  - Database manager initialization and cleanup
  - Concurrent database access (up to 10 concurrent operations)
  - Health check integration (success and failure scenarios)
  - FastAPI dependency injection
  - Error handling and recovery
  - Complete health check service integration

## Notes

- Tests use temporary SQLite databases to avoid interference with existing data
- Concurrent testing validates thread-safety and connection pooling behavior
- Error handling tests cover various failure scenarios including invalid paths and connection issues
- Performance tests ensure health checks complete within acceptable time limits (< 1 second per check)
- All tests include proper cleanup to prevent resource leaks
- Tests are designed to be independent and can run in any order
