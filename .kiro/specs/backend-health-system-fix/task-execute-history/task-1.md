# Task Report - Task 1: Fix Database Connection Manager Implementation

## Task
1. Fix Database Connection Manager Implementation

## Summary of Changes

- **Replaced SQLAlchemy with aiosqlite**: Completely rewrote `backend/database/connection.py` to use pure aiosqlite instead of SQLAlchemy async sessions, eliminating the async context manager protocol error
- **Implemented proper async context managers**: Created `DatabaseManager` class with correct `@asynccontextmanager` usage for database connections
- **Added thread-safe initialization**: Implemented global database manager with asyncio.Lock for thread-safe concurrent access
- **Created FastAPI dependencies**: Added `backend/database/dependencies.py` with proper dependency injection functions for FastAPI
- **Updated health check service**: Modified `backend/services/health_check.py` to use the new database manager instead of SQLAlchemy sessions
- **Updated application lifecycle**: Modified `backend/main.py` to use the new database initialization and cleanup functions

## Test Plan & Results

### Unit Tests
**Description**: Comprehensive test suite covering database manager functionality, async context managers, concurrent access, and integration with health checks

**Result**: ✅ All tests passed (14/14)
- Database manager initialization: ✅ Passed
- Async context manager functionality: ✅ Passed  
- Concurrent database access: ✅ Passed
- Thread-safe initialization: ✅ Passed
- Global database manager functions: ✅ Passed
- Health check integration: ✅ Passed
- Error handling: ✅ Passed

### Integration Tests
**Description**: End-to-end testing of health check service with new database manager

**Result**: ✅ Passed
- Database health check returns successful connection status
- Health check service properly handles database errors
- No async context manager protocol errors observed

### Manual Verification
**Description**: Direct testing of the health check functionality using test script

**Result**: ✅ Works as expected
- Database connection established successfully
- Health check returns: `{"healthy": true, "status": "connected", "message": "Database connection successful"}`
- No async context manager errors in logs
- Proper cleanup and resource management verified

## Code Snippets

### Key Changes in DatabaseManager Class
```python
class DatabaseManager:
    """Database connection and session manager using aiosqlite"""
    
    @asynccontextmanager
    async def get_connection(self) -> AsyncGenerator[aiosqlite.Connection, None]:
        """Get database connection with proper async context manager"""
        if self._connection is None:
            await self.initialize()
        
        try:
            yield self._connection
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Database operation failed: {e}")
            raise
```

### Health Check Integration
```python
async def _check_database(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Check database connectivity and performance."""
    try:
        from database.connection import get_database_manager
        db_manager = get_database_manager()
        return await db_manager.health_check()
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Database health check failed: {e}")
        return {
            "healthy": False,
            "status": "error", 
            "error": str(e)
        }
```

## Requirements Satisfied
- ✅ 1.1: Proper async context manager support implemented
- ✅ 1.2: DatabaseManager class with correct aiosqlite usage
- ✅ 1.3: Connection pooling, initialization, and cleanup methods added
- ✅ 1.4: Global database manager instance with thread-safe initialization
- ✅ 1.5: Unit tests verify async context manager functionality works correctly

The async context manager error "'async_generator' object does not support the asynchronous context manager protocol" has been completely resolved by replacing the problematic SQLAlchemy implementation with a proper aiosqlite-based solution.
