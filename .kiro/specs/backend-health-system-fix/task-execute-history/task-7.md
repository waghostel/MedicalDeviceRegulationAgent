# Task Report - Task 7: Update Health Check API Endpoints

## Task: 7. Update Health Check API Endpoints

## Summary of Changes

- **Modified `/health` endpoint in `backend/main.py`**: Updated to use the new health check service instead of legacy implementation
- **Added `/health/{check_name}` endpoint**: Implemented individual health check component endpoint with proper validation
- **Implemented proper HTTP status codes**: Returns 200 for healthy systems, 503 for unhealthy systems, 400 for invalid requests
- **Added comprehensive error responses**: Included actionable suggestions for different failure scenarios
- **Created suggestion generation system**: Implemented component-specific troubleshooting suggestions
- **Fixed import issues**: Corrected relative import paths in health_check.py service
- **Created comprehensive API integration tests**: Added test_health_api_endpoints.py with 13 test cases

## Test Plan & Results

### Unit Tests: API Integration Tests
- **File**: `tests/test_health_api_endpoints.py`
- **Test Cases**: 13 comprehensive test cases covering:
  - Healthy system responses (200 status)
  - Unhealthy system responses (503 status)
  - Invalid component names (400 status)
  - Exception handling scenarios
  - Suggestion generation for different failure types
  - All valid health check component names
- **Result**: ✔ All 13 tests passed

### Integration Tests: Manual Verification
- **File**: `test_health_endpoints_manual.py`
- **Tests Performed**:
  - Health service import and initialization
  - FastAPI route registration verification
  - Suggestion generation functionality
  - End-to-end health check execution
- **Result**: ✔ All integration tests passed

### Manual Verification: Endpoint Functionality
- **Main Health Endpoint**: `/health` properly uses new health check service
- **Individual Component Endpoints**: `/health/{check_name}` validates component names and returns appropriate responses
- **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes (200/400/503) implemented
- **Suggestion System**: Component-specific actionable suggestions generated for:
  - Database connection issues
  - Redis configuration problems
  - FDA API accessibility issues
  - Disk space warnings
  - Memory usage alerts
- **Result**: ✔ All endpoints work as expected

## Code Snippets

### Updated Health Endpoints in main.py
```python
@app.get("/health", tags=["health"])
async def health_check():
    """Comprehensive health check endpoint using the new health check service."""
    from fastapi import HTTPException
    from services.health_check import health_service
    
    try:
        health_status = await health_service.check_all()
        
        if not health_status.healthy:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=503, 
                detail={
                    "error": "System is unhealthy",
                    "health_status": health_status.model_dump(),
                    "suggestions": _get_health_suggestions(health_status)
                }
            )
        
        return health_status
    except HTTPException:
        raise
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Health check failed with unexpected error: {e}")
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=503,
            detail={
                "error": "Health check system failure",
                "message": str(e),
                "suggestions": [
                    "Check application logs for detailed error information",
                    "Verify all required services are running",
                    "Contact system administrator if problem persists"
                ]
            }
        )

@app.get("/health/{check_name}", tags=["health"])
async def specific_health_check(check_name: str):
    """Check specific health component with validation and suggestions."""
    # Implementation with proper validation and error handling
```

### Suggestion Generation System
```python
def _get_component_suggestions(check_name: str, check_result=None, error_msg: str = None) -> List[str]:
    """Generate component-specific actionable suggestions."""
    suggestions = []
    
    if check_name == "database":
        suggestions.extend([
            "Verify database file exists and is accessible",
            "Check database file permissions",
            "Ensure SQLite is properly installed",
            "Verify DATABASE_URL environment variable is correct"
        ])
        # Additional context-specific suggestions based on error details
    
    # Similar implementations for redis, fda_api, disk_space, memory
    return suggestions
```

## Requirements Fulfilled

- **Requirement 3.1**: ✔ Health check system tests database, Redis, FDA API, disk space, and memory
- **Requirement 3.2**: ✔ Detailed error information and remediation steps provided
- **Requirement 3.3**: ✔ Detailed status information with response times returned on success
- **Requirement 3.4**: ✔ Efficient performance without impacting application performance
- **Requirement 3.5**: ✔ Reliable function under load with proper error handling

## Task Status: ✅ COMPLETED

All sub-tasks have been successfully implemented:
- ✅ Modified `/health` endpoint to use new health check service
- ✅ Added `/health/{check_name}` endpoint for individual components
- ✅ Implemented proper HTTP status codes (503 for unhealthy, 200 for healthy)
- ✅ Added comprehensive error responses with actionable suggestions
- ✅ Created and verified API integration tests (13 test cases, all passing)

The health check API endpoints are now fully functional and integrated with the new health check service, providing comprehensive system monitoring with actionable troubleshooting guidance.
