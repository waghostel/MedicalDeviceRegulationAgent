# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for comprehensive frontend testing of the Medical Device Regulatory Assistant application. The goal is to create a complete testing strategy that validates all frontend components with mock data, identifies areas still using mock data, and establishes a migration path to connect components to the backend database.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Mock Data Audit and Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify all components currently using mock data, so that I can understand the current state and plan the migration to real data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conducting a mock data audit THEN the system SHALL identify all components currently using mock data from `src/lib/mock-data.ts`
2. WHEN documenting mock data usage THEN the system SHALL create a comprehensive mapping of which components use which mock data generators
3. WHEN analyzing data flow THEN the system SHALL document how mock data flows through the application (hooks, context, props)
4. WHEN reviewing API integration THEN the system SHALL identify which API endpoints are mocked vs implemented
5. WHEN documenting findings THEN the system SHALL create a migration priority matrix based on component criticality

### Requirement 2: Comprehensive Component Testing with Mock Data

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test all frontend components with their current mock data setup, so that I can ensure they work correctly before connecting to real backend services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing layout components THEN the system SHALL verify AppLayout, Header, and Sidebar render correctly with mock authentication
2. WHEN testing project components THEN the system SHALL verify ProjectCard, ProjectList, and NewProjectDialog work with mock project data
3. WHEN testing dashboard widgets THEN the system SHALL verify ClassificationWidget, PredicateWidget, and ProgressWidget display mock data correctly
4. WHEN testing agent components THEN the system SHALL verify CopilotSidebar and CitationPanel work with mock conversation data
5. WHEN testing form components THEN the system SHALL verify all forms handle validation and submission with mock responses
6. WHEN testing error states THEN the system SHALL verify all components handle error conditions gracefully
7. WHEN testing loading states THEN the system SHALL verify all components display appropriate loading indicators

### Requirement 3: Integration Testing with Mock Backend

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test complete user workflows with mock backend responses, so that I can validate the entire frontend flow before connecting to real services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing user authentication THEN the system SHALL mock NextAuth Google OAuth flow and verify session management
2. WHEN testing project creation THEN the system SHALL mock API calls and verify optimistic updates work correctly
3. WHEN testing device classification THEN the system SHALL mock classification API responses and verify widget updates
4. WHEN testing predicate search THEN the system SHALL mock FDA API responses and verify search results display
5. WHEN testing agent interactions THEN the system SHALL mock LangGraph agent responses and verify chat functionality
6. WHEN testing data persistence THEN the system SHALL mock database operations and verify state management
7. WHEN testing real-time features THEN the system SHALL mock WebSocket connections and verify live updates

### Requirement 4: End-to-End Testing with Playwright

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run complete user journeys through the application, so that I can ensure the entire user experience works seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing user onboarding THEN the system SHALL simulate complete login-to-project-creation flow
2. WHEN testing dashboard navigation THEN the system SHALL verify all page transitions and state persistence
3. WHEN testing agent workflow THEN the system SHALL simulate complete AI interaction scenarios
4. WHEN testing responsive design THEN the system SHALL verify layouts work on mobile, tablet, and desktop
5. WHEN testing accessibility THEN the system SHALL verify keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
6. WHEN testing performance THEN the system SHALL measure and validate page load times and interaction responsiveness
7. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN the system SHALL simulate network failures and verify error handling

### Requirement 5: Mock Data Migration Strategy

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear strategy for migrating from mock data to real backend connections, so that I can systematically replace mock implementations with real ones.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN planning migration THEN the system SHALL prioritize components based on user impact and technical complexity
2. WHEN migrating components THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with mock data during transition
3. WHEN connecting to backend THEN the system SHALL preserve existing mock data in database seed files
4. WHEN updating tests THEN the system SHALL modify tests to work with both mock and real data scenarios
5. WHEN validating migration THEN the system SHALL ensure no functionality is lost during the transition
6. WHEN completing migration THEN the system SHALL remove unused mock data generators and update documentation

### Requirement 6: Database Integration Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test frontend components with real database connections, so that I can ensure data persistence and retrieval work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up test database THEN the system SHALL create isolated test database instances for each test suite
2. WHEN seeding test data THEN the system SHALL populate test database with realistic data based on current mock data
3. WHEN testing CRUD operations THEN the system SHALL verify create, read, update, and delete operations work through the frontend
4. WHEN testing data validation THEN the system SHALL verify frontend validation matches backend schema validation
5. WHEN testing concurrent access THEN the system SHALL verify multiple users can access the same data safely
6. WHEN cleaning up tests THEN the system SHALL ensure test data is properly cleaned up after each test run

### Requirement 7: Performance and Accessibility Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the frontend meets performance and accessibility standards, so that all users can effectively use the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing performance THEN the system SHALL measure Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) for all key pages
2. WHEN testing accessibility THEN the system SHALL verify WCAG 2.1 AA compliance using automated tools
3. WHEN testing keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL verify all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
4. WHEN testing screen readers THEN the system SHALL verify proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML structure
5. WHEN testing color contrast THEN the system SHALL verify all text meets minimum contrast requirements
6. WHEN testing responsive design THEN the system SHALL verify layouts work across different screen sizes and orientations
7. WHEN testing loading performance THEN the system SHALL verify acceptable load times for all components and pages
