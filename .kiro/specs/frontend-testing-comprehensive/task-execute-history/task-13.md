# Task Report: Task 13 - Run Backend Tests

## Task: 13. Run backend tests

## Summary of Changes
- Executed comprehensive backend test suite using `poetry run python -m pytest tests/ -v`
- Added missing `nltk` dependency to resolve import errors
- Identified and documented test failures and system issues

## Test Plan & Results

### Unit Tests: Backend Service and API Testing
- **Command Executed**: `poetry run python -m pytest tests/ -v --tb=short`
- **Total Tests**: 489 tests collected
- **Result**: ❌ **108 failed, 309 passed, 10 skipped, 62 errors**

### Test Results Breakdown

#### ✅ **Successful Test Categories** (309 passed):
- Basic authentication service tests
- Health check service core functionality  
- Audit logger basic operations
- Database connection management
- Project service basic CRUD operations
- Agent state management
- Tool registry core functionality

#### ❌ **Major Failure Categories**:

**1. Import/Dependency Errors (4 errors resolved, others remain):**
- ✅ Fixed: `nltk` module missing - resolved by adding to dependencies
- ❌ Missing: `sentence_transformers` - commented out due to Python 3.13 compatibility
- ❌ Missing: `psutil` for performance monitoring
- ❌ Import errors: Missing functions in auth middleware (`validate_jwt_token`, `hash_password`, `verify_password`)

**2. Database Configuration Issues (62 errors):**
- `AttributeError: 'DatabaseConfig' object has no attribute 'startswith'`
- Affects all database-dependent tests
- Database connection string parsing issues

**3. Authentication System Failures (50+ failures):**
- JWT token validation not working properly
- Authentication middleware returning 401/403 instead of expected responses
- User object missing required attributes (`sub` field)

**4. API Integration Issues:**
- FastAPI client initialization problems
- AsyncClient configuration errors
- CORS and security header issues

**5. Tool Registry Validation Errors:**
- Pydantic validation failures in device classification tools
- Tool initialization failures due to missing fields
- Circuit breaker and retry mechanism issues

**6. Performance Test Failures:**
- Load testing showing 0% success rates
- Memory usage monitoring failing due to missing `psutil`
- Concurrent user testing failures

**7. Security Test Failures:**
- Rate limiting not enforced
- Security headers missing
- Input validation bypassed

### Integration Tests: API and Database Integration
- **Result**: ❌ **Major failures in database integration**
- Database configuration parsing issues prevent proper testing
- Authentication integration completely broken
- FDA API integration partially working (some tests skipped)

### Manual Verification: Test Environment Assessment
- **Result**: ⚠️ **Test environment has significant configuration issues**
- Poetry environment properly configured
- Dependencies partially missing due to Python 3.13 compatibility
- Database schema and connection issues
- Authentication system needs major fixes

## Key Issues Identified

### Critical Issues (Blocking):
1. **Database Configuration**: `DatabaseConfig` object parsing failures
2. **Authentication System**: JWT validation and user management broken
3. **Missing Dependencies**: `sentence_transformers`, `psutil` not available for Python 3.13
4. **Tool Validation**: Pydantic model validation errors across all tools

### High Priority Issues:
1. **API Client Configuration**: AsyncClient initialization problems
2. **Security Implementation**: Missing rate limiting and security headers
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Load testing infrastructure broken
4. **Error Handling**: Many tests failing due to improper error handling

### Medium Priority Issues:
1. **Deprecation Warnings**: 271 warnings about deprecated `datetime.utcnow()`
2. **Test Fixture Issues**: Async fixture compatibility problems
3. **Mock Configuration**: Some mock services not properly configured

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Fix Database Configuration**: Resolve `DatabaseConfig` parsing issues
2. **Implement Missing Auth Functions**: Add `validate_jwt_token`, `hash_password`, `verify_password`
3. **Add Missing Dependencies**: Install `psutil` and resolve `sentence_transformers` compatibility
4. **Fix Pydantic Models**: Resolve validation errors in tool classes

### Short-term Improvements:
1. **Update Datetime Usage**: Replace deprecated `datetime.utcnow()` with `datetime.now(datetime.UTC)`
2. **Fix Test Fixtures**: Resolve async fixture compatibility issues
3. **Implement Security Features**: Add rate limiting and security headers
4. **Fix Performance Tests**: Restore load testing functionality

### Long-term Considerations:
1. **Python 3.13 Compatibility**: Fully resolve ML library compatibility issues
2. **Test Coverage**: Improve test coverage for critical paths
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Ensure tests can run reliably in automated environments

## Test Coverage Analysis
- **Passing Tests**: 63% (309/489) - Basic functionality works
- **Critical Path Coverage**: Authentication and database operations mostly failing
- **Integration Coverage**: Partial - some components work in isolation but fail when integrated

## Conclusion
The backend test suite reveals significant system integration issues that need immediate attention. While core business logic appears to work (63% pass rate), critical infrastructure components (database, authentication, security) have major problems that would prevent the application from functioning properly in production.

**Status**: ❌ **Tests reveal critical system issues requiring immediate fixes**
**Next Steps**: Address database configuration and authentication system before proceeding with frontend integration testing.
