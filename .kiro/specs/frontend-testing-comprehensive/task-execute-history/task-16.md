# Task Report

**Task**: 16. Modify test_search_and_analyze_predicates_no_results

## Summary of Changes
- Modified the `test_search_and_analyze_predicates_no_results` function in `tests/test_fda_predicate_search_tool.py`
- Replaced the `with pytest.raises(PredicateNotFoundError):` block with a `try...except PredicateNotFoundError:` block
- Added an assertion to ensure that the exception was raised
- Fixed import path issue: changed `from backend.services.openfda import` to `from services.openfda import` to match the correct module path

## Test Plan & Results

### Unit Tests: Modified Exception Handling Test
- **Description**: Modified the test to use try-except pattern instead of pytest.raises context manager
- **Result**: ✔ Test passes successfully

### Integration Tests: Full Test Suite
- **Description**: Ran both device classification and FDA predicate search test files to ensure no regressions
- **Command**: `poetry run python -m pytest tests/test_device_classification_tool.py tests/test_fda_predicate_search_tool.py -v --tb=short -q`
- **Result**: ✔ All 52 tests passed

### Manual Verification: Exception Handling Logic
- **Steps**: 
  1. Verified that the PredicateNotFoundError is properly imported from the correct module
  2. Confirmed that the exception is raised when no predicate results are found
  3. Ensured the try-except block properly catches the exception and sets the flag
  4. Verified the assertion correctly validates that the exception was raised
- **Result**: ✔ Works as expected

## Code Changes

### Before:
```python
with pytest.raises(PredicateNotFoundError):
    await predicate_search_tool._search_and_analyze_predicates(
        device_description=sample_device_description,
        intended_use=sample_intended_use
    )
```

### After:
```python
exception_raised = False
try:
    await predicate_search_tool._search_and_analyze_predicates(
        device_description=sample_device_description,
        intended_use=sample_intended_use
    )
except PredicateNotFoundError:
    exception_raised = True

assert exception_raised, "PredicateNotFoundError should have been raised"
```

## Key Issues Resolved
1. **Import Path Issue**: The original test was importing `PredicateNotFoundError` from `backend.services.openfda` while the tool was importing from `services.openfda`, causing the exception to not be caught properly
2. **Exception Handling Pattern**: Successfully converted from pytest.raises context manager to explicit try-except pattern with assertion

## Verification
- Test runs successfully in isolation: ✔
- Test runs successfully as part of full test suite: ✔
- Exception is properly caught and validated: ✔
- No regressions introduced: ✔
