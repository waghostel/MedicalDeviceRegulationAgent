2. WHEN I click a quick action THEN I SHALL execute the same functionality as the corresponding slash command
3. WHEN I use the File Explorer THEN I SHALL be able to manage project documents with folder creation, renaming, and descriptive notes
4. WHEN I access the Citation and Source Panel THEN I SHALL see an expandable sidebar with all sources, URLs, and effective dates
5. WHEN I click on citations THEN I SHALL be taken directly to the original FDA documents

### Requirement 6: Markdown Editor and Document Management

**User Story:** As a regulatory affairs manager, I want to create and edit regulatory documents with AI assistance, so that I can efficiently prepare submission materials with proper formatting and citations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the Markdown Editor THEN I SHALL see a web-based editor with integrated AI "Copilot" functionality
2. WHEN I use `@` mentions THEN I SHALL be able to link to other project resources and documents
3. WHEN I save documents THEN I SHALL store them as markdown files for maximum LLM compatibility
4. WHEN I upload PDF or DOCX files THEN I SHALL see them converted to clean markdown automatically
5. WHEN I edit documents THEN I SHALL see real-time collaboration features and version tracking

### Requirement 7: Audit Trail and Compliance

**User Story:** As a regulatory affairs manager, I want complete traceability of all AI actions and decisions, so that I can maintain compliance with regulatory requirements and provide audit trails during inspections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI performs any action THEN I SHALL see it logged in a detailed, human-readable audit log
2. WHEN I view the audit log THEN I SHALL see what action was taken, why, when, and what sources were used
3. WHEN I export audit trails THEN I SHALL receive comprehensive reports suitable for regulatory inspections
4. WHEN AI provides recommendations THEN I SHALL see confidence scores and complete reasoning traces
5. WHEN I review AI outputs THEN I SHALL be required to approve critical decisions before use in formal submissions

### Requirement 8: openFDA API Integration (Backend)

**User Story:** As a regulatory affairs manager, I want access to real-time FDA data for predicate searches and device classification, so that I can make decisions based on the most current regulatory information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I search for predicates THEN I SHALL receive results from live openFDA API queries, not static data
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN I SHALL have proper rate limiting (240 requests/minute) and error handling
3. WHEN I query device classifications THEN I SHALL receive current FDA product codes and CFR sections
4. WHEN I access adverse event data THEN I SHALL see monitoring capabilities for predicate devices

5. WHEN classification confidence is low THEN I SHALL receive alternative approaches and expert consultation recommendations

### Requirement 11: Agent Tool Architecture (Backend)

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a robust backend architecture that supports AI agents with proper tool integration, so that the system can reliably execute complex regulatory workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents execute tasks THEN I SHALL have LangGraph-based state management with checkpoints for long-running processes
