## Code Snippets
### pyproject.toml changes
```toml
# Added to [tool.poetry.dependencies] section
aiohttp = "^3.10.0"
```

### Test verification
```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp

async def test_aiohttp():
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        print("✓ aiohttp ClientSession created successfully")
        print(f"✓ aiohttp version: {aiohttp.__version__}")
        return True

# Result: ✓ aiohttp is working correctly!
```

## Notes
- The poetry install process encountered some issues with torch installation, but aiohttp was successfully installed
- The backend server still has other module import issues (asyncpg), but the aiohttp ModuleNotFoundError has been resolved
- aiohttp is now available for use in the backend services, particularly in health_check.py and load_test.py files
