- ✅ Dynamic imports for MDEditor to avoid SSR issues
- ✅ Efficient tree rendering with proper key props

### Accessibility Features
- ✅ Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- ✅ ARIA labels and roles for screen readers
- ✅ Focus management in dropdown components
- ✅ High contrast support for visual indicators
