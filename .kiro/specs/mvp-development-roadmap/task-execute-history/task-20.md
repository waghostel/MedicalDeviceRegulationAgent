    action_filter: Optional[str] = Query(None),
    start_date: Optional[datetime] = Query(None),
    end_date: Optional[datetime] = Query(None),
    limit: int = Query(100, le=1000),
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user),
    audit_logger: AuditLogger = Depends(get_audit_logger)
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Get audit trail for a project with filtering options"""
    audit_entries = await audit_logger.get_audit_trail(
        project_id=project_id,
        user_id=user_id,
        action_filter=action_filter,
        start_date=start_date,
        end_date=end_date,
        limit=limit
    )
    
    summary = await audit_logger.get_audit_summary(
        project_id=project_id,
        user_id=user_id
    )
    
    return {
        "audit_entries": audit_entries,
        "summary": summary,
        "total_count": len(audit_entries)
    }
```

### Compliance Reporting
```python

    request: ComplianceReportRequest,
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user),
    audit_logger: AuditLogger = Depends(get_audit_logger)
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Generate compliance report with confidence scores and source citations"""
    
    audit_entries = await audit_logger.get_audit_trail(
        project_id=request.project_id,
        limit=10000
    )
    
    compliance_metrics = await _generate_compliance_metrics(audit_entries)
    
    return {
        "compliance_metrics": compliance_metrics,
        "regulatory_compliance": {
            "fda_traceability": True,
            "complete_reasoning_traces": compliance_metrics["reasoning_completeness"] >= 0.95,
            "source_citations_complete": compliance_metrics["citation_completeness"] >= 0.95,
            "confidence_scores_present": compliance_metrics["confidence_score_coverage"] >= 0.95

```

### Frontend API Integration
```typescript
// Real-time audit updates
const unsubscribe = auditAPI.subscribeToAuditUpdates(
  parseInt(projectId),
  (newInteraction) => {
    setInteractions(prev => [newInteraction, ...prev]);
    toast({
      title: "New Audit Entry",
      description: `${newInteraction.agentAction} completed`,
    });
  },
  (error) => {
    toast({
      title: "Connection Error",
      description: "Lost connection to audit stream",
      variant: "destructive",
    });
  }
);
```

### Integrity Verification
```python
async def verify_audit_integrity(
    project_id: int,
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user),
    audit_logger: AuditLogger = Depends(get_audit_logger)
) -> AuditIntegrityResponse:
    """Verify audit trail integrity and detect tampering"""
    
    audit_entries = await audit_logger.get_audit_trail(
        project_id=project_id,
        limit=10000
    )
    
    verified_entries = 0
    tampered_entries = []
    
    for entry in audit_entries:
        if await _verify_entry_integrity(entry):
            verified_entries += 1
        else:
            tampered_entries.append(entry["id"])
    
    integrity_score = verified_entries / len(audit_entries) if audit_entries else 1.0
    
    return AuditIntegrityResponse(
        is_valid=len(tampered_entries) == 0,
        total_entries=len(audit_entries),
        verified_entries=verified_entries,
        tampered_entries=tampered_entries,
        integrity_score=integrity_score,
        verification_timestamp=datetime.utcnow(),
        hash_algorithm="SHA-256"
    )
