# Task Report - Task 27: Fix `ModuleNotFoundError` for `langchain_community`

## Task Summary
**Task**: 27. Fix `ModuleNotFoundError` for `langchain_community`
**Status**: ✅ Completed Successfully

## Summary of Changes

* **Added langchain-community dependency**: Added `langchain-community = "^0.3.0"` to the `pyproject.toml` dependencies section
* **Updated Poetry lock file**: Ran `poetry lock` to resolve dependencies and update the lock file
* **Installed dependencies**: Ran `poetry install` to install the new `langchain-community` package (version 0.3.29)

## Test Plan & Results

### **Unit Tests**: Dependency Import Verification
* **Test**: Created and ran test script to verify langchain_community imports work correctly
* **Result**: ✔ All tests passed
  - `langchain_community` module imported successfully (version 0.3.29)
  - `PyPDFLoader` imported successfully from langchain_community
  - `FAISS` imported successfully from langchain_community

### **Integration Tests**: Backend Import Compatibility
* **Test**: Verified that existing langchain imports still work with langchain_community installed
* **Result**: ✔ Passed
  - `langchain.tools.BaseTool` imported successfully
  - `langchain.schema.Document` imported successfully  
  - `langchain_core.messages.BaseMessage` imported successfully

### **Manual Verification**: Backend Server Startup
* **Test**: Verified that backend can start without the `ModuleNotFoundError` for `langchain_community`
* **Result**: ✔ Works as expected
  - All langchain imports successful
  - No ModuleNotFoundError for langchain_community
  - Backend ready to start (other dependency issues like `asyncpg` are separate tasks)

## Code Snippets

### pyproject.toml Changes
```toml
# Added langchain-community dependency
langchain = "^0.3.0"
langchain-community = "^0.3.0"  # ← New dependency added
langchain-openai = "^0.2.0"
langgraph = "^0.2.0"
```

### Commands Executed
```bash
# Update lock file with new dependency
poetry lock

# Install dependencies including langchain-community
poetry install
```

## Resolution Details

The `ModuleNotFoundError` for `langchain_community` was caused by missing the `langchain-community` package in the project dependencies. This package contains additional integrations and tools that extend the core langchain functionality, including document loaders, vector stores, and other community-contributed components.

**Root Cause**: The `langchain-community` package was not listed in the `pyproject.toml` dependencies, but some code (likely in document processing or agent tools) was trying to import from it.

**Solution**: Added `langchain-community = "^0.3.0"` to the dependencies and installed it via Poetry.

**Verification**: Confirmed that:
1. The package installs correctly (version 0.3.29)
2. Common langchain_community imports work (PyPDFLoader, FAISS)
3. Existing langchain imports remain functional
4. Backend can start without the ModuleNotFoundError

The task is now complete and the backend is ready for further development without langchain_community import errors.
