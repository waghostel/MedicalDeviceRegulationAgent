# ✅ Task 3: Regulatory Strategy Dashboard UI - COMPLETED

## What was implemented:

### TypeScript Interfaces and Types (`src/types/dashboard.ts`):
- **DeviceClassification interface**: Complete interface with device class, product code, regulatory pathway, confidence scores, and reasoning
- **PredicateDevice interface**: Comprehensive predicate device data with K-numbers, confidence scores, comparison matrices, and selection status
- **ProjectProgress interface**: Progress tracking across all regulatory milestones (classification, predicate search, comparison analysis, submission readiness)
- **Supporting interfaces**: SourceCitation, ComparisonMatrix, TechnicalCharacteristic for complete data modeling
- **Status enums**: Proper status management for pending, in-progress, completed, and error states

### Dashboard Widget Components:

#### ClassificationWidget (`src/components/dashboard/classification-widget.tsx`):
- Built with Shadcn Card, Badge, Button, and Progress components
- Displays device classification status, product code, regulatory pathway
- Confidence score visualization with color-coded indicators
- CFR sections display with overflow handling
- Interactive states for empty, in-progress, completed, and error conditions
- Reasoning display for completed classifications

#### PredicateWidget (`src/components/dashboard/predicate-widget.tsx`):
- Comprehensive predicate device management interface
- Top matches display with confidence rankings
- Average confidence calculation and visualization
- Selected predicates summary with K-number badges
- Interactive predicate selection with external link actions
- Statistics display (total found, selected count)
- Empty state with call-to-action for predicate search

#### ProgressWidget (`src/components/dashboard/progress-widget.tsx`):
- Visual progress tracking across all regulatory milestones
- Weighted progress calculation including submission readiness percentage
- Step-by-step progress indicators with completion badges
- Confidence score display for completed steps
- Next action recommendations based on current progress
- Quick stats for classification and predicate confidence
- Interactive step navigation with click handlers

### Main Dashboard Layout (`src/components/dashboard/regulatory-dashboard.tsx`):
- Responsive CSS Grid layout optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Three-column layout with proper widget arrangement
- Recent activity timeline with status indicators
- Quick actions panel for common workflows
- Error and loading state management
- Project context integration

### Mock Data Generators (`src/lib/mock-data.ts`):
- **generateMockDeviceClassification**: Realistic FDA device classification data
- **generateMockPredicateDevice**: Complete predicate device with comparison matrices
- **generateMockProjectProgress**: Progress tracking with realistic completion states
- **generateMockPredicateDevices**: Bulk predicate generation for testing
- **generateMockClassifications**: Multiple classification states for testing
- Configurable overrides for specific test scenarios

### Dashboard State Management (`src/components/providers/dashboard-context.tsx`):
- React Context implementation with useReducer for complex state management
- Complete CRUD operations for projects, classifications, and predicates
- Automatic progress calculation and updates
- Predicate selection/deselection management
- Loading and error state handling
- Helper functions for common operations
- Type-safe action dispatchers

### Demo Page (`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`):
- Complete dashboard demonstration with mock data initialization
- Interactive demo controls for testing workflows
- Proper context provider setup
- Event handlers for all dashboard interactions

- Filter logic for completed vs pending predicates

### ProgressWidget Tests (10 tests):
- Overall progress calculation with weighted scoring
- Step completion status and badges
- Confidence score display for completed steps
- Next action recommendations based on progress state
- Interactive step navigation
- Quick stats display
- Progress details for each milestone
- 100% completion handling

### DashboardContext Tests (10 tests):
- Initial state validation
- Project ID management
- Classification setting and progress updates
- Predicate device management (add, update, select/deselect)
- Progress tracking updates
- Loading and error state management
- Dashboard reset functionality
- Context provider error handling
