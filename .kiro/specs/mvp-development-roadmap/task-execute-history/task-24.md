## Code Snippets

### Docker Production Configuration
```yaml
# docker-compose.prod.yml - Production deployment with scaling
services:
  frontend:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.frontend
      target: runner
    deploy:
      replicas: 2
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '1.0'
          memory: 1G
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:3000/api/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 5
```

### Comprehensive Health Check Service
```python
# backend/services/health_check.py - Production health monitoring
class HealthCheckService:
    async def check_all(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Perform all health checks and return comprehensive status."""
        start_time = time.time()
        results = {}
        overall_healthy = True
        
        # Run all checks concurrently
        tasks = []
        for check_name, check_func in self.checks.items():
            task = asyncio.create_task(self._run_check(check_name, check_func))
            tasks.append(task)
        
        check_results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
        # Process results with proper error handling...
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

    - name: Run tests
      run: pnpm test --coverage
      
  deploy-production:
    needs: [frontend-tests, backend-tests, security-scan]

      run: ./scripts/deploy.sh deploy --version ${{ github.sha }}
```

    least_conn;
    server frontend:3000 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=30s;
    keepalive 32;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    
    # Security headers
    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload" always;
    add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'..." always;
    
    location / {
