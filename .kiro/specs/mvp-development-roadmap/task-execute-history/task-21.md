## Code Snippets

### Redis Caching Implementation
```python
class CacheManager:
    """High-level cache manager for different data types"""
    
    async def cache_fda_search(self, search_query: str, results: List[Dict[str, Any]], ttl: int = 3600) -> bool:
        """Cache FDA search results"""
        return await self.cache.set("fda_search", search_query, results, ttl)
    
    async def get_fda_search(self, search_query: str) -> Optional[List[Dict[str, Any]]]:
        """Get cached FDA search results"""
        return await self.cache.get("fda_search", search_query)
```

### Database Performance Indexes
```python
async def create_performance_indexes(self) -> List[str]:
    """Create performance indexes for common queries"""
    project_indexes = [
        "CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_projects_user_id ON projects(user_id)",
        "CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_projects_status ON projects(status)",
        "CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_agent_interactions_project_id ON agent_interactions(project_id)",
        "CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_predicate_devices_confidence ON predicate_devices(confidence_score)",
    ]
    # Execute index creation...
```

### API Response Compression
```python
class CompressionMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):
    """Middleware for compressing API responses"""
    
    async def dispatch(self, request: Request, call_next) -> Response:
        response = await call_next(request)
        
        if self._should_compress(request, response):
            compressed_body = await self._compress_data(response_body)
            # Return compressed response with proper headers
```

### Background Job Processing
```python
class BackgroundJobProcessor:
    """Background job processor that executes jobs from the queue"""
    
    async def enqueue_job(self, job_type: str, job_data: Dict[str, Any], priority: JobPriority = JobPriority.NORMAL) -> str:
        """Convenience method to enqueue a job"""
        return await self.job_queue.enqueue(job_type, job_data, priority)
```

### Frontend Performance Monitoring
```typescript
export function useApiPerformance() {
  const recordApiRequest = useCallback(async <T>(
    requestFn: () => Promise<T>,
    endpoint: string,
    method: string = 'GET'
  ): Promise<T> => {
    const startTime = performance.now();
    
    try {
      const result = await requestFn();
      const duration = performance.now() - startTime;
      
      performanceMonitor.recordMetric('api_request', duration, {
        endpoint, method, status: 'success'
      });
      
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      // Record error metrics...
      throw error;
    }
  }, []);
}
```

### Code Splitting with Lazy Loading
```typescript
export const LazyProjectHub = createLazyComponent(
  () => import('../../components/projects/ProjectHub'),
  'ProjectHub'
);

export function createLazyComponent<T extends ComponentType<any>>(
  importFn: () => Promise<{ default: T }>,
  componentName: string
): LazyExoticComponent<T> {
  return React.lazy(async () => {
    const startTime = performance.now();
    
    try {
      const module = await importFn();
      const loadTime = performance.now() - startTime;
      
      performanceMonitor.recordMetric('component_lazy_load', loadTime, {
        component: componentName, status: 'success'
      });
      
      return module;
    } catch (error) {
      // Record error metrics...
      throw error;
    }
  });
