# System Error Resolution - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the systematic resolution of critical errors identified in the Medical Device Regulatory Assistant project. The analysis revealed four major categories of issues: frontend testing infrastructure failures, backend integration problems, configuration inconsistencies, and performance bottlenecks. This spec provides a structured approach to resolve these issues and establish a robust, production-ready system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Frontend Testing Infrastructure Stabilization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable frontend tests that execute consistently without React lifecycle errors, so that I can confidently develop and deploy new features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running frontend test suites THEN all React state updates SHALL be properly wrapped in `act()` utility
2. WHEN components render during tests THEN all asynchronous operations SHALL complete before assertions
3. WHEN toast notifications are triggered THEN test components SHALL render without lifecycle warnings
4. WHEN test suites execute THEN syntax errors SHALL be eliminated from all component files
5. WHEN MSW integration is used THEN it SHALL be simplified to avoid TypeScript/JavaScript conflicts
6. WHEN test utilities are imported THEN they SHALL work consistently across all test files

### Requirement 2: Backend Integration Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want backend integration tests that run reliably without race conditions or connection failures, so that I can validate the complete system workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database CRUD operations are tested THEN race conditions SHALL be eliminated through proper test isolation
2. WHEN API endpoints are tested THEN connection failures SHALL be handled gracefully with retry logic
3. WHEN custom exceptions are thrown THEN they SHALL be consistently mapped to appropriate HTTP responses
4. WHEN test cleanup occurs THEN database state SHALL be properly reset without affecting other tests
5. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL not depend on external server instances being available
6. WHEN project operations are tested THEN proper transaction management SHALL prevent data corruption

### Requirement 3: Configuration and Environment Standardization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent development and testing environments that work reliably across different machines and setups, so that I can focus on feature development rather than environment issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the development environment THEN package managers SHALL be standardized (pnpm for frontend, poetry for backend)
2. WHEN running tests THEN environment variables SHALL be validated before execution
3. WHEN importing modules THEN path resolution SHALL work consistently across all environments
4. WHEN test configurations are loaded THEN they SHALL not conflict with development configurations
5. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN version conflicts SHALL be prevented through proper lock files
6. WHEN environment validation runs THEN missing requirements SHALL be clearly reported with fixing instructions

### Requirement 4: Error Handling and Exception Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent error handling across all system layers, so that debugging is straightforward and error responses are predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exceptions occur in services THEN they SHALL be mapped to appropriate HTTP status codes
2. WHEN API errors are returned THEN they SHALL follow a consistent response format
3. WHEN database operations fail THEN errors SHALL be properly categorized and logged
4. WHEN validation errors occur THEN they SHALL provide clear, actionable feedback
5. WHEN system errors happen THEN they SHALL include sufficient context for debugging
6. WHEN error boundaries are triggered THEN users SHALL receive helpful error messages

### Requirement 5: Test Performance and Resource Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want fast, efficient tests that don't consume excessive resources or time, so that I can run them frequently during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test suites execute THEN they SHALL complete within 30 seconds for the full suite
2. WHEN database connections are used THEN they SHALL be properly pooled and cleaned up
3. WHEN React components are tested THEN memory leaks SHALL be prevented through proper cleanup
4. WHEN mock data is generated THEN it SHALL be efficiently created and destroyed
5. WHEN performance regressions occur THEN they SHALL be automatically detected and reported
6. WHEN resource usage is high THEN tests SHALL provide warnings and optimization suggestions

### Requirement 6: Monitoring and Validation Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive monitoring of test execution and system health, so that I can proactively identify and resolve issues before they impact development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests execute THEN performance metrics SHALL be collected and analyzed
2. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be categorized and tracked for trend analysis
3. WHEN test failures happen THEN detailed diagnostic information SHALL be provided
4. WHEN system health is checked THEN all critical components SHALL be validated
5. WHEN performance thresholds are exceeded THEN alerts SHALL be generated
6. WHEN test results are generated THEN they SHALL include actionable recommendations for improvements

### Requirement 7: Documentation and Developer Experience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation and tooling that helps me understand and resolve issues quickly, so that I can maintain high productivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN diagnostic messages SHALL include clear fixing instructions
2. WHEN setting up the environment THEN step-by-step guides SHALL be provided
3. WHEN running tests THEN progress and results SHALL be clearly displayed
4. WHEN debugging issues THEN comprehensive logging SHALL be available
5. WHEN best practices are needed THEN they SHALL be documented and easily accessible
6. WHEN troubleshooting THEN common issues and solutions SHALL be readily available

### Requirement 8: Continuous Integration and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated quality checks that prevent regressions and ensure consistent code quality, so that the system remains stable as it evolves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN automated tests SHALL run and validate all changes
2. WHEN test failures occur THEN they SHALL block deployment until resolved
3. WHEN performance regressions are detected THEN they SHALL be flagged for review
4. WHEN code quality issues are found THEN they SHALL be reported with specific recommendations
5. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN compatibility SHALL be automatically verified
6. WHEN releases are prepared THEN comprehensive validation SHALL ensure system readiness

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success Metrics (Critical Fixes)
- Frontend test success rate: 95%+
- Backend integration test success rate: 100%
- Zero critical syntax or import errors
- Consistent test execution across environments

### Phase 2 Success Metrics (Stabilization)
- Test execution time: <30 seconds for full suite
- Zero environment-related test failures
- Comprehensive error handling coverage
