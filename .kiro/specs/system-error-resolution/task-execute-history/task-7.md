## Code Snippets

### Package Manager Validation Script Core Function
```bash
validate_frontend_setup() {
    log_info "Validating frontend package management (pnpm)..."
    
    # Check pnpm installation
    if ! command_exists pnpm; then
        log_error "pnpm not installed. Install with: npm install -g pnpm"
        return 1
    fi
    
    # Validate package.json configuration
    if grep -q '"packageManager"' "$FRONTEND_DIR/package.json"; then
        local package_manager=$(grep '"packageManager"' "$FRONTEND_DIR/package.json" | cut -d'"' -f4)
        if [[ "$package_manager" == pnpm* ]]; then
            log_success "packageManager field correctly specifies: $package_manager"
        else
            log_error "packageManager field specifies '$package_manager' instead of pnpm"
            return 1
        fi
    fi
}
```

### Dependency Management Script Architecture
```bash
# Main command structure with comprehensive options
case $COMMAND in
