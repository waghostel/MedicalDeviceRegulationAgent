### Simplified/Streamlined Development Processes

#### Process Simplification 1: Automated Dependency Management
**Before**: Manual dependency installation and version management
**After**: Automated detection and installation of required dependencies
- **Example**: `js-yaml` automatically installed when needed by CI validation script
- **Benefit**: Reduces setup friction and ensures consistent environments

#### Process Simplification 2: Unified Quality Command
**Before**: Running multiple separate quality tools manually
**After**: Single `pnpm quality:full` command runs comprehensive checks
- **Components**: Code quality + test coverage + performance + security + reporting
- **Benefit**: One-command quality validation for developers

#### Process Simplification 3: Integrated Health Monitoring
**Before**: Manual monitoring of system components and metrics
**After**: Automated health dashboard with real-time monitoring
- **Features**: Web interface, auto-refresh, alerting, comprehensive metrics
- **Benefit**: Proactive issue detection and system visibility

#### Process Simplification 4: Pre-commit Automation
**Before**: Manual code quality checks before commits
**After**: Automated pre-commit hooks with comprehensive validation
- **Coverage**: Formatting, linting, type checking, testing, security
- **Benefit**: Prevents quality issues from entering the codebase

### Undone Tests/Skipped Tests
- [ ] **End-to-end CI pipeline execution** (requires GitHub Actions environment)
  - **Reason**: Requires actual CI/CD environment to test full pipeline
  - **Risk**: Low - workflow structure and logic validated manually
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive manual review and validation completed

- [ ] **Pre-commit hooks installation and execution** (requires git repository setup)
  - **Reason**: Requires git repository setup and pre-commit installation
  - **Risk**: Low - hook configuration validated, installation is standard process
  - **Mitigation**: Clear setup instructions provided in CI setup script

- [ ] **Health dashboard web interface testing** (requires running servers)
  - **Reason**: Requires running frontend/backend servers to test full functionality
  - **Risk**: Medium - web interface functionality not fully validated
  - **Mitigation**: HTML generation logic validated, server startup logic tested

- [ ] **Performance regression testing with historical data** (requires baseline data)
  - **Reason**: Requires historical quality reports for comparison
  - **Risk**: Low - regression detection logic validated with mock data
  - **Mitigation**: System will generate baseline data on first run

- [ ] **Security vulnerability scanning with real vulnerabilities** (requires vulnerable dependencies)
  - **Reason**: Current project has no known vulnerabilities to test against
  - **Risk**: Low - scanning logic validated, tools are industry standard
  - **Mitigation**: Integration with established security tools (Safety, npm audit)
