## Code Examples and Usage Patterns

### Enhanced Testing Utilities

```typescript
// React testing with proper act() wrapping
import { renderWithProviders, waitForAsyncUpdates } from '@/lib/testing/react-test-utils';

const { getByText } = await renderWithProviders(<MyComponent />);
fireEvent.click(getByText('Button'));
await waitForAsyncUpdates();
expect(getByText('Result')).toBeInTheDocument();
```

### Database Test Isolation

```python
# Database testing with automatic rollback
async with isolation.isolated_session() as session:
    user = User(email="test@example.com")
    session.add(user)
    await session.flush()  # Get ID without committing
    # All changes automatically rolled back on exit
```

### Performance Monitoring

```python
# Test performance monitoring
with monitor.monitor_test("my_test") as monitor_id:
    # Perform operations
    monitor.record_database_query(monitor_id)
    # Performance automatically tracked
```

### Error Handling

```python
# Unified exception handling
raise ProjectNotFoundError(
    project_id=123,
    user_id="user_456",
    additional_context={"attempted_action": "update"}
)
# Automatically provides user-friendly message and suggestions
```
