## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issues (Critical - Blocking Success):

#### 1. Frontend Testing Infrastructure (Impact: 78% gap)
- **Root Cause**: React testing utilities not consistently applied across all tests
- **Symptoms**: act() warnings, component rendering failures, mock system issues
- **Impact**: Prevents reliable frontend development and deployment confidence
- **Solution Required**: Complete integration of testing utilities from previous tasks

#### 2. Backend Test Environment (Impact: 44% gap)
- **Root Cause**: Database configuration and import dependencies not properly set up
- **Symptoms**: Import errors, database initialization failures, test isolation issues
- **Impact**: Prevents reliable backend testing and validation
- **Solution Required**: Fix database manager initialization and test environment setup

#### 3. Test Execution Environment (Impact: Performance validation blocked)
- **Root Cause**: Command execution environment or timeout utility issues
- **Symptoms**: All performance tests fail immediately
- **Impact**: Cannot validate performance requirements
- **Solution Required**: Fix test execution environment and command configuration

### Secondary Issues (Medium Priority):

#### 4. Database Manager Integration
- **Root Cause**: Database isolation requires initialized database manager
- **Impact**: Performance monitoring incomplete
- **Solution**: Update database isolation to handle uninitialized manager gracefully

#### 5. Poetry Configuration
- **Root Cause**: Missing README.md file in backend directory
- **Impact**: Package manager validation fails
- **Solution**: Create missing documentation file
