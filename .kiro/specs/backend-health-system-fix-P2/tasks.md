# Medical Device Regulatory Assistant - Test Failure Analysis & Resolution Tasks

## Executive Summary

The Medical Device Regulatory Assistant backend test suite is experiencing widespread failures across 227 test cases, with only 395 passing. This comprehensive analysis identifies root causes and provides actionable tasks to resolve the systemic issues affecting the test infrastructure.

## Development Rules

- Use **`pnpm`** instead of npm for JavaScript/TypeScript.
- Use **`poetry`** for Python commands (e.g. `poetry run python test_document_tool.py`).
- Create the test script and run it instead of run it directly with `poetry run python -c`
- Follow **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**.
- Always clear the terminal before running a new command. Type the clear command first, press Enter, then type the actual command and press Enter again.
- Document the faild and skipped test in the from chat history into **Undone tests/Skipped test**.

Example 1(Windows):

```bash
cls
<command>
```

Example 2 (Mac and Linux)

```bash
clear
<command>
```

- After reading this file, say: **"I will use poetry and pnpm"**.

## Workflow

1. Create a code-writing plan for the task.
2. Define the testing criteria.
3. Fetch related documentation (context7) if needed.
4. Implement the task/code.
5. Run tests after completing the task.
   - If tests fail, fetch additional documentation (context7).
6. Write a **task report** in `./.kiro/specs/[your-spec-name]/task-execute-history/` (e.g. `task-1.1.md`).
   - Be transparent about test results, especially if some tests require future verification.
   - If the test script has been modified, skipped in the developemnt process or skipped chat history, document faild and skipped test in **Undone tests/Skipped test**.
7. Check previous chat history and verify whether any tests were passed, simplified, or skipped during development. Ensure all are documented following our task report format. Provide the exact test command for each test, starting from the root of the codebase.
8. 
## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

### Testing Guidelines

1. **Pre-Development**
   - Clearly define the **expected test outcomes** before coding begins.
2. **Post-Development**

   - Document **all test results** in:

     ```shell
     ./.kiro/specs/[your-spec-name]/task-execute-history/
     ```

   - This ensures full **traceability** of test executions.

3. **Failed Tests**
   - **Definition**: Tests that did not pass in the latest test run.
   - **Action**: Record the test name, the failure reason, and provide a reference to the related test report.
4. **Skipped and Simplified Tests**
   - **Definition**: Tests that are skipped or simplified because the problem is either too complex or outside the current project scope.
   - **Action**: Identify them from the development process or chat history, and clearly document the reason for skipping.

### Task Report Format

Each completed task requires a report:

### **Overarching Recommendation: Dependency Injection and Test Fixture Factories**

A recurring theme in these failures is the lack of a consistent dependency injection (DI) pattern, which makes mocking and service isolation difficult. As we fix these issues, we should establish a pattern of creating "test fixture factories." This means creating a set of reusable fixtures that provide services (like the `ProjectService` or `OpenFDAService`) with their dependencies (like the database) already mocked or configured for a test environment. This will make writing robust and isolated tests for new features much easier in the future.

---

## Category 1: Test Environment and Database Infrastructure (Critical Priority)

### Analysis

**Affected Tests**: 45+ tests including all `test_database_*`, `test_project_*`, `test_auth_*`, and health check tests.

**Error Patterns**:

```
database.exceptions.DatabaseError: Database error in connection_initialize: Database initialization failed: Connection...
RuntimeError: Critical service initialization failed: Database initialization failed: Connection...
assert 500 == 503  # Health check failures
KeyError: 'service'  # Missing configuration
```

**Root Cause Investigation**:

- **Lack of a Centralized Test Environment:** Tests fail because they are running without a consistent and predictable environment configuration. Critical environment variables like `DATABASE_URL` are not set, and services requiring external dependencies (like Redis) are not disabled or mocked.
- **Global State and Lack of Isolation:** The codebase relies on a global `db_manager` instance (`database/connection.py`). This is an anti-pattern for testing as it creates shared state between tests, leading to unpredictable failures. One test can affect the outcome of another.
- **Incorrect Async Database Setup for Tests:** The current test fixtures do not correctly set up and tear down the async database engine and sessions for an in-memory SQLite database, which has specific connection requirements for testing.

**Evidence from Codebase**:

- No centralized test environment setup is present in `conftest.py`.
- `database/connection.py` uses a global `db_manager` that is initialized once and shared.
- Test fixtures in `conftest.py` do not properly isolate database instances for each test function.

### Resolution Tasks

- [x] 1. Test File Organization and Consolidation (Prerequisite)

  - **Audit and Categorize Existing Test Files:** Review all 227+ test files in the backend directory and categorize them by functionality (database, API, services, integration, performance)

  - **Consolidate Redundant Test Files:** Merge duplicate or overlapping test files that test the same functionality to reduce maintenance overhead

  - **Create Organized Test Directory Structure:** Establish clear directory structure: `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/fixtures/`, `tests/utils/`

  - **Remove Obsolete Test Files:** Delete test files that are no longer relevant or have been superseded by newer implementations

  - **Create Test File Naming Convention:** Establish consistent naming patterns for test files to improve discoverability and organization

  - Dependencies: None (prerequisite task)

  - Test command: `cd medical-device-regulatory-assistant/backend && find . -name "test_*.py" | wc -l` (should show reduced count)

- [x] 2. Establish a Centralized Test Environment and Fix Database Fixtures

  - **Create a Centralized Test Environment:** In `conftest.py`, create a session-scoped, autouse fixture to set all necessary environment variables (`TESTING`, `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, etc.) before any tests run. This ensures all tests run with a consistent configuration.

  - **Eliminate Global State in Tests:** Refactor the database fixtures to create a new, isolated in-memory database for each test function. This fixture should bypass the global `db_manager` entirely.

  - **Implement Correct Async Session Management:** The new fixture must use `create_async_engine` with `StaticPool` and correctly manage the lifecycle of the engine and session, yielding a session to the test and then cleaning up properly.

  - **Update All Database-Dependent Tests:** All tests that interact with the database must be updated to use the new, reliable session fixture.

  - **Add Development Guidelines:** Add a note to the project's development guide discouraging the use of global state and requiring the use of the new database fixture for all database-related tests.

  - Dependencies: Task 1 (Test File Organization)

  - Potential root cause: A combination of missing test environment configuration and a global database manager that is not isolated between tests.

  - Potential solution: Create a single, session-scoped fixture in `conftest.py` to configure the environment, and a separate function-scoped fixture to provide an isolated, in-memory database session for each test.

  - Test command: `cd medical-device-regulatory-assistant/backend && poetry run python -m pytest tests/test_database_integration.py -v && poetry run python -m pytest tests/test_health_check_service.py -v`

  - Code snippet:

    ```python
    # Fix in conftest.py
    import os
    import pytest
    from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import create_async_engine, async_sessionmaker
    from sqlalchemy.pool import StaticPool

    @pytest.fixture(scope="session", autouse=True)
    def setup_test_environment():
        os.environ["TESTING"] = "true"
        os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "sqlite+aiosqlite:///:memory:"
        os.environ["REDIS_URL"] = ""  # Disable Redis for testing
        os.environ["JWT_SECRET"] = "test_secret"
        yield
        # Cleanup
        for key in ["TESTING", "DATABASE_URL", "REDIS_URL", "JWT_SECRET"]:
            os.environ.pop(key, None)

    @pytest_asyncio.fixture(scope="function")
    async def test_db_session():
        engine = create_async_engine(
            "sqlite+aiosqlite:///:memory:",
            poolclass=StaticPool,
            connect_args={"check_same_thread": False}
        )

        async with engine.begin() as conn:
            await conn.run_sync(Base.metadata.create_all)

        async_session = async_sessionmaker(engine, expire_on_commit=False)

        async with async_session() as session:
            yield session

        await engine.dispose()
    ```

## Category 2: HTTP Client Testing Issues (High Priority)

### Analysis

**Affected Tests**: All API endpoint tests, security tests, performance tests

**Error Patterns**:

```
httpx.ConnectError: All connection attempts failed
TypeError: AsyncClient.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'app'
AttributeError: 'async_generator' object has no attribute 'post'
```

**Root Cause Investigation**:

- Incorrect usage of `httpx.AsyncClient` with FastAPI applications.
- Test fixtures creating async generators instead of proper client instances.
- Missing proper async context management in test setup.
- **Misunderstanding of FastAPI Testing Patterns:** The team is not using the recommended `TestClient`. According to FastAPI's official documentation, `TestClient` is the preferred tool for most testing scenarios. It runs in the same thread as the test function, which simplifies debugging and allows for synchronous test code (i.e., no `async`/`await`), making tests cleaner and easier to read. `AsyncClient` is only necessary for advanced cases where you need to call other async functions within the test itself.

### Resolution Tasks

- [x] 3. Fix HTTP Client Testing Patterns

  - Replace incorrect AsyncClient(app=app) usage with proper TestClient pattern as recommended by FastAPI documentation

  - Fix async generator issues in test fixtures that are returning generators instead of client instances

  - Implement proper async context management for HTTP tests using TestClient with context managers

  - Update all API endpoint tests to use synchronous TestClient pattern instead of AsyncClient

  - Remove httpx.AsyncClient usage from test files where TestClient should be used

  - Update test fixtures to return proper client instances instead of async generators

  - Dependencies: Task 2 (Database Fixtures)

  - Potential root cause: Incorrect usage of httpx.AsyncClient with FastAPI applications and async generators being returned instead of client objects

  - Potential solution: Use FastAPI's TestClient with proper context management for all API testing

  - Test command: `cd medical-device-regulatory-assistant/backend && poetry run python -m pytest tests/integration/api/test_project_api.py -v`

  - Code snippet:

    ```python
    # Fix in conftest.py - Replace AsyncClient with TestClient
    from fastapi.testclient import TestClient

    @pytest.fixture
    def client():
        with TestClient(app) as client:
            yield client

    # Fix in test files - Use synchronous testing pattern
    def test_endpoint(client):
        response = client.get("/api/endpoint")
        assert response.status_code == 200
        assert response.json() == expected_data

    # Remove incorrect AsyncClient usage
    # OLD (incorrect):
    # async with httpx.AsyncClient(app=app, base_url="http://test") as client:
    #     response = await client.get("/")

    # NEW (correct):
    # response = client.get("/")
    ```

---

## Category 3: Model and Enum Definition Issues (Medium Priority)

### Analysis

**Affected Tests**: Dashboard and project status tests

**Error Patterns**:

```
AttributeError: type object 'ProjectStatus' has no attribute 'ACTIVE'
```

**Root Cause Investigation**:

- Mismatch between expected enum values and actual enum definitions
- The `ProjectStatus` enum in `models/project.py` defines `DRAFT`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `COMPLETED` but tests expect `ACTIVE`
- Inconsistent enum usage across the codebase

**Evidence from Code Review**:

```python
# Current definition in models/project.py
class ProjectStatus(enum.Enum):
    DRAFT = "draft"
    IN_PROGRESS = "in_progress"
    COMPLETED = "completed"
    # Missing ACTIVE status that tests expect
```

### Resolution Tasks

- [x] 4. Fix Model Enum Definitions and Consistency

  - Standardize ProjectStatus enum values across the entire codebase to include missing ACTIVE status

  - Update all test files to use correct enum values that match the model definitions

  - Review and fix any database schema inconsistencies related to enum values

  - **Add and Verify Database Migration:** Add a database migration for the enum change. **Note:** Modifying an `Enum` in an existing database with Alembic can be complex. The `autogenerate` command may not produce a correct script. This will likely require a custom-written migration script to `ALTER TYPE` correctly on PostgreSQL or handle the equivalent change in SQLite. This must be tested carefully.

  - Ensure consistent enum usage in services, models, and API responses

  - Update API documentation to reflect correct enum values

  - Dependencies: Task 2 (Database Fixtures), Task 3 (HTTP Client Patterns)

  - Potential root cause: Mismatch between expected enum values in tests (ACTIVE) and actual enum definitions (DRAFT, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED)

  - Potential solution: Add missing ACTIVE status to ProjectStatus enum and update all references

  - Test command: `cd medical-device-regulatory-assistant/backend && poetry run python -m pytest tests/integration/test_dashboard_integration.py::TestDashboardIntegration::test_get_dashboard_data_success -v`

  - Code snippet:

    ```python
    # Fix in models/project.py
    class ProjectStatus(enum.Enum):
        DRAFT = "draft"
        ACTIVE = "active"  # Add missing status
        IN_PROGRESS = "in_progress"
        COMPLETED = "completed"

    # Update tests to use correct enum values
    # OLD: ProjectStatus.ACTIVE (doesn't exist)
    # NEW: ProjectStatus.ACTIVE (now exists) or ProjectStatus.IN_PROGRESS

    # Update database migration if needed
    # alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add ACTIVE status to ProjectStatus enum"
    ```

## Category 4: OpenFDA Service Integration Issues (Medium Priority)

### Analysis

**Affected Tests**: All OpenFDA integration tests (10 skipped tests)

**Error Patterns**:

```
SKIPPED: FDA API not available: 'async_generator' object has no attribute 'search_predicates'
services.openfda.FDAAPIError: Failed to search adverse events: 'coroutine' object has no attribute...
```

**Root Cause Investigation**:

- The OpenFDA service is returning async generators instead of proper service instances
- Mock setup for FDA API testing is incorrect
- Service instantiation pattern is not compatible with test fixtures
- Missing proper async service method definitions

**Evidence from Service Code**:
The `services/openfda.py` file shows the service class exists but test fixtures are not properly instantiating it, leading to async generator objects being returned instead of service instances.

### Resolution Tasks

- [x] 5. Fix OpenFDA Service Integration and Mocking

  - Create proper mock OpenFDA service instances for testing instead of async generators

  - Fix service instantiation pattern to return proper service objects with expected methods

  - Implement comprehensive async service testing fixtures with proper mocking

  - Update OpenFDA service class to ensure methods like search_predicates are properly defined and accessible

  - Create test-specific OpenFDA client configuration that doesn't require actual API access

  - Implement proper error handling for service unavailability scenarios

  - Dependencies: Task 3 (HTTP Client Patterns)

  - Potential root cause: OpenFDA service returning async generators instead of service instances and missing expected methods

  - Potential solution: Implement proper service mocking with all required methods and fix service instantiation

  - Test command: `cd medical-device-regulatory-assistant/backend && poetry run python -m pytest tests/integration/services/test_openfda_integration.py -v`

  - Code snippet:

    ```python
    # Fix in conftest.py - Add proper OpenFDA service fixture
    @pytest.fixture
    def mock_openfda_service():
        service = OpenFDAService(api_key="test_key")
        with patch.object(service, '_make_request') as mock_request:
            mock_request.return_value = {
                "results": [
                    {
                        "k_number": "K123456",
                        "device_name": "Test Device",
                        "intended_use": "Test use",
                        "product_code": "ABC"
                    }
                ]
            }
            yield service

    # Fix service instantiation in tests
    def test_predicate_search(mock_openfda_service):
        results = await mock_openfda_service.search_predicates("test device")
        assert len(results) > 0
        assert results[0].k_number == "K123456"
    ```

---

## Category 5: Authentication and JWT Token Issues (Medium Priority)

### Analysis

**Affected Tests**: All authentication-related tests

**Error Patterns**:

```
assert 500 == 201  # Expected success, got server error
assert 500 == 401  # Expected unauthorized, got server error
```

**Root Cause Investigation**:

- Authentication middleware is causing server errors instead of proper auth validation
- JWT token generation and validation is not working in test environment
- Mock authentication setup is incomplete or misconfigured
- Authentication service dependencies are not properly mocked

**Evidence from Test Results**:
All authentication tests return 500 status codes regardless of whether tokens are valid, invalid, or missing, indicating a fundamental issue with the authentication middleware in test environments.

### Resolution Tasks

- [x] 6. Fix Authentication and JWT Token Testing

  - Create proper JWT token generation and validation mocking for test environments

  - Fix authentication middleware configuration to work correctly in test scenarios

  - **Create Clear Authentication Fixtures:** Create two separate, clearly named fixtures: one that provides headers for a valid, authenticated user, and another that provides empty headers for unauthenticated requests. This will make the security context of each test explicit and easier to understand.

  - Update authentication service to handle test environment properly without causing server errors

  - Create mock user authentication that bypasses actual OAuth flow for testing

  - Add proper error handling in authentication middleware to prevent 500 errors

  - Dependencies: Task 3 (HTTP Client Patterns), Task 5 (Service Integration)

  - Potential root cause: Authentication middleware causing 500 server errors instead of proper auth validation responses

  - Potential solution: Implement test-specific authentication mocking and fix middleware error handling

  - Test command: `cd medical-device-regulatory-assistant/backend && poetry run python -m pytest tests/integration/auth/test_auth_endpoints.py::TestProjectsAuthentication::test_create_project_valid_auth -v`

  - Code snippet:

    ```python
    # Fix in conftest.py - Add auth fixtures
    @pytest.fixture
    def authenticated_headers():
        """Provides headers for a valid, authenticated user."""
        token = create_test_jwt_token({
            "sub": "test_user",
            "email": "test@example.com",
            "name": "Test User"
        })
        return {"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}

    @pytest.fixture
    def unauthenticated_headers():
        """Provides empty headers for an unauthenticated user."""
        return {}

    @pytest.fixture
    def mock_auth_service():
        with patch('services.auth.get_current_user') as mock_auth:
            mock_auth.return_value = TokenData(
                sub="test_user",
                email="test@example.com",
                name="Test User"
            )
            yield mock_auth

    # Fix authentication middleware error handling
    # Add try-catch blocks to prevent 500 errors
    async def auth_middleware(request, call_next):
        try:
            # Authentication logic
            return await call_next(request)
        except AuthenticationError:
            return JSONResponse(
                status_code=401,
                content={"detail": "Authentication failed"}
            )
    ```

## Category 6: Service Property and Dependency Issues (Low Priority)

### Analysis

**Affected Tests**: Project service tests

**Error Patterns**:

```
AttributeError: property 'db_manager' of 'ProjectService' object has no setter
```

**Root Cause Investigation**:

- Service classes have read-only properties that tests are trying to modify
- Dependency injection pattern is not compatible with test mocking
- Service initialization requires proper database manager injection

### Resolution Tasks

- [x] 6.1. Fix Database Manager Initialization Issues (Critical Priority)

  - Fix "Database manager not initialized" errors in API endpoints that are causing 500 status codes

  - Ensure database manager is properly initialized in test environment before API tests run

  - Fix error tracking table creation issues ("no such table: error_reports")

  - Create proper database schema initialization for test environment

  - Dependencies: Task 2 (Database Fixtures), Task 3 (HTTP Client Patterns)

  - Potential root cause: Database manager not being initialized when API endpoints are called in test environment

  - Potential solution: Ensure database manager initialization happens before API tests and create missing error tracking tables

  - Test command: `cd medical-device-regulatory-assistant/backend && poetry run python -m pytest tests/integration/api/test_project_api.py::TestProjectAPI::test_create_project_success -v`

  - Code snippet:

    ```python
    # Fix in conftest.py - Ensure database manager initialization
    @pytest.fixture(scope="session", autouse=True)
    def initialize_database_manager():
        """Initialize database manager for test environment"""
        from database.connection import initialize_database_manager
        initialize_database_manager()
        yield
        # Cleanup if needed

    # Fix in database/connection.py - Add test environment initialization
    def initialize_database_manager():
        """Initialize database manager for current environment"""
        global db_manager
        if db_manager is None:
            db_manager = DatabaseManager()
            # Create error tracking tables if they don't exist
            asyncio.run(db_manager.create_error_tracking_tables())
    ```

- [x] 7. Fix Service Property and Dependency Injection Issues

  - Refactor service classes to use proper dependency injection instead of read-only properties

  - Update service initialization to accept database manager injection for testing

  - Create service factory functions that can be easily mocked in test environments

  - Dependencies: Task 5 (OpenFDA Service Integration)

  - Potential root cause: Currently using mocked OpenFDA responses, need real API integration

  - Potential solution: Configure service to use real FDA API with proper authentication and error handling

  - Test command: `cd medical-device-regulatory-assistant/backend && poetry run python -c "import asyncio; from services.openfda import create_openfda_service; import os; os.environ['FDA_API_KEY']='your_key'; service = asyncio.run(create_openfda_service(api_key=os.environ.get('FDA_API_KEY'))); print('Real API configured')"`

  - Code snippet:

    ```python
    # Fix in core/environment.py - Add FDA API configuration
    FDA_API_KEY = os.getenv("FDA_API_KEY")
    USE_REAL_FDA_API = os.getenv("USE_REAL_FDA_API", "false").lower() == "true"

    # Fix in services/openfda.py - Add real API factory
    async def create_production_openfda_service() -> OpenFDAService:
        """Create OpenFDA service for production use with real API"""
        api_key = os.getenv("FDA_API_KEY")
        if not api_key:
            logger.warning("FDA_API_KEY not set, some features may be limited")

        redis_url = os.getenv("REDIS_URL")
        return await create_openfda_service(
            api_key=api_key,
            redis_url=redis_url,
            cache_ttl=3600
        )

    if not os.getenv("TESTING"):
        openfda_service = await create_production_openfda_service()
    else:
        openfda_service = create_successful_openfda_mock()
    ```

- [x] 9. Test Infrastructure Validation and Performance Optimization

  - **Validate Test Isolation:** Run tests multiple times to ensure no cross-test contamination or race conditions

  - **Performance Benchmarking:** Measure test execution time and ensure full suite completes within 60 seconds

  - **Memory Leak Detection:** Monitor memory usage during test execution to identify and fix memory leaks

  - **CI/CD Integration Testing:** Ensure all fixes work correctly in automated CI/CD environments

  - **Create Test Maintenance Documentation:** Document new testing patterns and best practices for future development

  - Dependencies: All previous tasks (1-8)

  - Potential root cause: Service classes have read-only properties that tests cannot modify and improper dependency injection patterns

  - Potential solution: Implement constructor-based dependency injection and remove read-only property constraints

  - Test command: `cd medical-device-regulatory-assistant/backend && python test_task_9_validation.py`

  - Code snippet:

    ```python

        def db_manager(self):
            return self._db_manager

        # Remove read-only constraint, allow injection
        def set_db_manager(self, db_manager: DatabaseManager):
            self._db_manager = db_manager

    # Fix in tests - Use dependency injection
    @pytest.fixture
    def project_service(test_db_manager):
        return ProjectService(db_manager=test_db_manager)
    ```

## Phase 5: Real OpenFDA API Enhancement and Production Readiness (New Tasks)

### Analysis

**Current Status**: Tasks 6-9 are completed with basic real OpenFDA API integration. The system can connect to the real FDA API and switch between mock and real services based on environment. However, additional enhancements are needed for production readiness and comprehensive testing.

**Enhancement Opportunities**:
- Comprehensive real API testing with actual FDA data
- Advanced caching strategies for production performance
- Enhanced error handling and retry mechanisms
- Production monitoring and alerting

## Success Metrics

### Current Status (After Tasks 1-5 ✅)

- **Tasks 1-5 Completed**: Test organization, database fixtures, HTTP client patterns, enum definitions, and OpenFDA service integration
- **OpenFDA Integration Tests**: 18/18 passing ✅
- **OpenFDA Database Tests**: 2 passing, 8 properly skipping (expected behavior) ✅
- **Current Failing Tests**: API tests failing due to "Database manager not initialized" (Task 6.1)

### Target Metrics

- **Target**: Reduce failed tests from 227 to <20
- **Database Tests**: All database integration tests should pass
- **API Tests**: All endpoint tests should return correct status codes (currently failing with 500 errors)
- **Service Tests**: All service mocking should work properly ✅
- **Real API Integration**: OpenFDA service should work with real FDA API when configured
- **CI/CD**: Test suite should run successfully in automated environment

## Conclusion

These test failures represent systemic architectural issues rather than individual test problems. The proposed tasks address root causes systematically, starting with the most critical database and HTTP client issues. Once the core infrastructure is fixed, the majority of the 227 failing tests should pass without individual modifications.

The integrated approach ensures that fixes are comprehensive and sustainable, providing a solid foundation for future development and maintaining high code quality standards for the Medical Device Regulatory Assistant project.

## Current Mock Services and Real API Integration Plan

### Currently Using Mocks

The following services are currently using mock implementations for testing and development:

#### 1. OpenFDA Service Mocking

- **Location**: `tests/fixtures/mock_services.py`
- **Mock Type**: Comprehensive mock factory with multiple scenarios
- **Current Behavior**:
  - Returns predefined FDA search results for predicate devices
  - Simulates device classification lookups
  - Provides adverse event data
  - Includes error scenarios and empty result handling
- **Mock Data Examples**:
  ```python
  FDASearchResult(
      k_number="K123456",
      device_name="Test Device",
      intended_use="Test indication for medical use",
      product_code="ABC",
      clearance_date="2023-01-01",
      confidence_score=0.85
  )
  ```

#### 2. Redis Cache Mocking

- **Location**: `tests/fixtures/mock_services.py`
- **Mock Type**: AsyncMock with standard Redis operations
- **Current Behavior**:
  - Simulates cache get/set operations
  - Provides connection status mocking
  - Returns predefined cache responses

#### 3. Authentication Service Mocking

- **Location**: `tests/fixtures/mock_services.py`
- **Mock Type**: Mock with OAuth simulation
- **Current Behavior**:
  - Bypasses Google OAuth flow
  - Returns test user data
  - Simulates token validation

### Tasks to Connect to Real APIs

#### Task 8: Real OpenFDA API Integration

- **Goal**: Replace mock OpenFDA service with real FDA API calls
- **Requirements**:
  - FDA API key configuration via `FDA_API_KEY` environment variable
  - Rate limiting compliance (240 requests/minute)
  - Proper error handling for API failures
  - Circuit breaker pattern for resilience
  - Redis caching for performance
- **Configuration**:
  ```bash
  # Environment variables needed
  FDA_API_KEY=your_fda_api_key_here
  USE_REAL_FDA_API=true
  REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
  ```

#### Future Real API Integrations (Not in Current Scope)

- **Google OAuth**: Currently mocked, will need real OAuth flow for production
- **Redis Cache**: Currently mocked, will need real Redis instance for production
- **Database**: Currently using SQLite, may need PostgreSQL for production

### Mock vs Real API Decision Matrix

| Service        | Test Environment             | Development Environment | Production Environment |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| OpenFDA API    | Mock (Task 5 ✅)             | Mock → Real (Task 8)    | Real API (Task 8)      |
| Redis Cache    | Mock (Task 5 ✅)             | Optional Real           | Real Required          |
| Authentication | Mock (Task 6)                | Mock → Real OAuth       | Real OAuth             |
| Database       | In-memory SQLite (Task 2 ✅) | File SQLite             | PostgreSQL             |

### Benefits of Current Mock Strategy

1. **Test Reliability**: Tests don't depend on external API availability
2. **Development Speed**: No API keys required for basic development
3. **Cost Control**: No API usage charges during testing
4. **Offline Development**: Can develop without internet connection
5. **Predictable Responses**: Consistent test data for reliable testing

### Migration Path to Real APIs

1. **Phase 1** (Current): All services mocked for testing
2. **Phase 2** (Task 8): OpenFDA API real integration with fallback to mocks
3. **Phase 3** (Future): Full production deployment with all real services
4. **Phase 4** (Future): Advanced features like ML-based predicate matching

This approach ensures a smooth transition from development to production while maintaining test reliability and development velocity.
