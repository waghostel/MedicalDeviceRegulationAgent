# Backend Health System Fix P2 - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the systematic resolution of critical backend test infrastructure failures in the Medical Device Regulatory Assistant project. The analysis identified 227 failing tests across multiple categories including database infrastructure, HTTP client testing, model definitions, service integration, authentication, and dependency injection. This spec provides a structured approach to resolve these systemic issues while maintaining the existing FastAPI/SQLAlchemy architecture and establishing robust testing patterns for future development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Test Infrastructure Stabilization

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want reliable database test fixtures that provide proper isolation and cleanup, so that I can write consistent database tests without race conditions or state pollution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running database tests THEN each test SHALL have an isolated in-memory SQLite database instance
2. WHEN database fixtures are used THEN they SHALL bypass the global database manager for test isolation
3. WHEN test sessions are created THEN they SHALL use StaticPool configuration for in-memory databases
4. WHEN tests complete THEN database state SHALL be automatically cleaned up without affecting other tests
5. WHEN database operations fail in tests THEN proper error handling SHALL prevent test suite crashes
6. WHEN multiple tests run concurrently THEN database isolation SHALL prevent cross-test interference

### Requirement 2: HTTP Client Testing Standardization

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want standardized HTTP client testing patterns using FastAPI's recommended TestClient, so that API endpoint tests are reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing API endpoints THEN FastAPI's TestClient SHALL be used instead of httpx.AsyncClient
2. WHEN HTTP client fixtures are created THEN they SHALL return proper client instances not async generators
3. WHEN API tests run THEN they SHALL use synchronous testing patterns for simplicity and reliability

6. WHEN OAuth flow is tested THEN mock authentication SHALL bypass external providers

### Requirement 6: Dependency Injection and Service Configuration

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want proper dependency injection patterns for services, so that test mocking and service isolation work reliably.

5. WHEN service initialization fails THEN clear error messages SHALL indicate the problem
6. WHEN services are cleaned up THEN proper disposal SHALL prevent resource leaks

### Requirement 7: Test Environment and Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want centralized test environment configuration that ensures consistent test execution across different machines and CI environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN environment variables SHALL be automatically configured
2. WHEN test configuration is loaded THEN it SHALL not conflict with development settings
3. WHEN external services are required THEN they SHALL be properly mocked or disabled in tests
4. WHEN test databases are created THEN they SHALL use appropriate connection settings
5. WHEN test cleanup occurs THEN environment state SHALL be restored properly
6. WHEN tests run in CI THEN they SHALL have the same behavior as local execution

### Requirement 8: Performance and Resource Management

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want efficient test execution that completes quickly and doesn't consume excessive resources, so that I can run tests frequently during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the full test suite runs THEN it SHALL complete within 60 seconds
2. WHEN database connections are used THEN they SHALL be properly pooled and cleaned up
3. WHEN memory usage is monitored THEN tests SHALL not cause memory leaks
4. WHEN test data is created THEN it SHALL be efficiently generated and destroyed
5. WHEN performance regressions occur THEN they SHALL be detected and reported
6. WHEN resource limits are exceeded THEN tests SHALL provide clear warnings

### Requirement 9: Error Handling and Debugging Support

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want comprehensive error handling and debugging information in tests, so that I can quickly identify and resolve test failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test failures occur THEN detailed error information SHALL be provided
2. WHEN exceptions are raised THEN they SHALL include sufficient context for debugging
3. WHEN database operations fail THEN the specific SQL and parameters SHALL be logged
