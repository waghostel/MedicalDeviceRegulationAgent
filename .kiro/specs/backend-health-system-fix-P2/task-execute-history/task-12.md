  - **Simplified To**: Basic functionality validation without external dependencies

### Tests Skipped Due to Dependencies
- [ ] **Real FDA API Integration Tests**
  - **Test Command**: `cd medical-device-regulatory-assistant/backend && poetry run python -c "import asyncio; from services.openfda import create_openfda_service; service = asyncio.run(create_openfda_service(api_key='test')); print('Real API configured')"`
  - **Status**: Skipped - requires real FDA API key and network access
  - **Reason**: Production API testing requires valid credentials and external network access

- [ ] **Redis Integration Tests**
  - **Test Command**: `cd medical-device-regulatory-assistant/backend && poetry run python -c "import redis.asyncio as redis; client = redis.Redis.from_url('redis://localhost:6379'); print('Redis connected')"`
