**Failed**: 227  
**Passed**: 395  
**Skipped**: 10  

The failures fall into distinct categories requiring targeted architectural fixes rather than individual test patches.

---

## Category 1: Database Infrastructure Issues (Critical Priority)

### Analysis

**Affected Tests**: 45+ tests including all `test_database_*`, `test_project_*`, and `test_auth_*` files

**Error Patterns**:
```
database.exceptions.DatabaseError: Database error in connection_initialize: Database initialization failed: Connection...
RuntimeError: Critical service initialization failed: Database initialization failed: Connection...
```

**Root Cause Investigation**:
- The `DatabaseManager` class fails to initialize properly in test environments
- SQLite async connection setup conflicts with test isolation requirements
- Global database manager pattern creates state conflicts between tests
- Connection pooling configuration is incompatible with in-memory SQLite testing

**Evidence from Codebase**:
- `database/connection.py` uses global state management unsuitable for testing
- Test fixtures in `conftest.py` don't properly isolate database instances
- `get_database_manager()` function returns uninitialized instances in test context

### Resolution Tasks

- [ ] 1. Fix Database Testing Infrastructure
  - Refactor database test fixtures to use proper async session management with isolated in-memory databases
  - Implement test-specific database configuration that bypasses the global database manager pattern
  - Create isolated database instances for each test function to ensure proper test isolation
  - Fix SQLite async connection pooling configuration for test environments
  - Update all database-dependent test fixtures to use the new pattern
  - Update `conftest.py` to properly manage database lifecycle in tests
  - Potential root cause: DatabaseManager class initialization fails in test environments due to improper async connection setup and global state conflicts
  - Potential solution: Create test-specific database fixtures using create_async_engine with StaticPool and proper async session management
  - Test command: `cd medical-device-regulatory-assistant/backend && poetry run python -m pytest tests/test_database_integration.py -v`
  - Code snippet:
    ```python
    # Fix in conftest.py
    @pytest_asyncio.fixture(scope="function")
    async def test_db_session():
        engine = create_async_engine(
            "sqlite+aiosqlite:///:memory:",
            poolclass=StaticPool,
            connect_args={"check_same_thread": False}
        )
        
        async with engine.begin() as conn:
            await conn.run_sync(Base.metadata.create_all)
        
        async_session = async_sessionmaker(engine, expire_on_commit=False)
        
        async with async_session() as session:
            yield session
        
        await engine.dispose()
    
    # Fix in database/connection.py - Add test mode
    class DatabaseManager:
        def __init__(self, database_config: Union[str, DatabaseConfig], test_mode: bool = False):
            self.test_mode = test_mode
            # ... rest of initialization
    ```

## Category 2: HTTP Client Testing Issues (High Priority)

### Analysis

**Affected Tests**: All API endpoint tests, security tests, performance tests

**Error Patterns**:
```
httpx.ConnectError: All connection attempts failed
TypeError: AsyncClient.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'app'
AttributeError: 'async_generator' object has no attribute 'post'
```

**Root Cause Investigation**:
- Incorrect usage of `httpx.AsyncClient` with FastAPI applications
- Test fixtures creating async generators instead of proper client instances
- Missing proper async context management in test setup
- FastAPI documentation recommends `TestClient` for most testing scenarios, not `AsyncClient`

**Evidence from FastAPI Documentation**:
According to FastAPI's official testing documentation, `TestClient` should be used for synchronous tests, while `AsyncClient` is only needed for specific async testing scenarios where you need to call other async functions within the test.

### Resolution Tasks

- [ ] 2. Fix HTTP Client Testing Patterns
  - Replace incorrect AsyncClient(app=app) usage with proper TestClient pattern as recommended by FastAPI documentation
  - Fix async generator issues in test fixtures that are returning generators instead of client instances
  - Implement proper async context management for HTTP tests using TestClient with context managers
  - Update all API endpoint tests to use synchronous TestClient pattern instead of AsyncClient
  - Remove httpx.AsyncClient usage from test files where TestClient should be used
  - Update test fixtures to return proper client instances instead of async generators
  - Potential root cause: Incorrect usage of httpx.AsyncClient with FastAPI applications and async generators being returned instead of client objects
  - Potential solution: Use FastAPI's TestClient with proper context management for all API testing
  - Test command: `cd medical-device-regulatory-assistant/backend && poetry run python -m pytest tests/test_project_api.py -v`
  - Code snippet:
    ```python
    # Fix in conftest.py - Replace AsyncClient with TestClient
    from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
    
    @pytest.fixture
    def client():
        with TestClient(app) as client:
            yield client
    
    # Fix in test files - Use synchronous testing pattern
    def test_endpoint(client):
        response = client.get("/api/endpoint")
        assert response.status_code == 200
        assert response.json() == expected_data
    
    # Remove incorrect AsyncClient usage
    # OLD (incorrect):
    # async with httpx.AsyncClient(app=app, base_url="http://test") as client:
    #     response = await client.get("/")
    
    # NEW (correct):
    # response = client.get("/")
    ```

## Category 3: Model and Enum Definition Issues (Medium Priority)

### Analysis

**Affected Tests**: Dashboard and project status tests

**Error Patterns**:
```
AttributeError: type object 'ProjectStatus' has no attribute 'ACTIVE'
```

**Root Cause Investigation**:
- Mismatch between expected enum values and actual enum definitions
- The `ProjectStatus` enum in `models/project.py` defines `DRAFT`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `COMPLETED` but tests expect `ACTIVE`
- Inconsistent enum usage across the codebase

**Evidence from Code Review**:
```python
# Current definition in models/project.py
class ProjectStatus(enum.Enum):
    DRAFT = "draft"
    IN_PROGRESS = "in_progress"
    COMPLETED = "completed"
    # Missing ACTIVE status that tests expect
```

### Resolution Tasks

- [ ] 3. Fix Model Enum Definitions and Consistency
  - Standardize ProjectStatus enum values across the entire codebase to include missing ACTIVE status
  - Update all test files to use correct enum values that match the model definitions
  - Review and fix any database schema inconsistencies related to enum values
  - Add database migration if schema updates are required for enum changes
  - Ensure consistent enum usage in services, models, and API responses
  - Update API documentation to reflect correct enum values
  - Potential root cause: Mismatch between expected enum values in tests (ACTIVE) and actual enum definitions (DRAFT, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED)
  - Potential solution: Add missing ACTIVE status to ProjectStatus enum and update all references
  - Test command: `cd medical-device-regulatory-assistant/backend && poetry run python -m pytest tests/test_dashboard_integration.py::TestDashboardIntegration::test_get_dashboard_data_success -v`
  - Code snippet:
    ```python
    # Fix in models/project.py
    class ProjectStatus(enum.Enum):
        DRAFT = "draft"
        ACTIVE = "active"  # Add missing status
        IN_PROGRESS = "in_progress"
        COMPLETED = "completed"
    
    # Update tests to use correct enum values
    # OLD: ProjectStatus.ACTIVE (doesn't exist)
    # NEW: ProjectStatus.ACTIVE (now exists) or ProjectStatus.IN_PROGRESS
    
    # Update database migration if needed
    # alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add ACTIVE status to ProjectStatus enum"
    ```

## Category 4: OpenFDA Service Integration Issues (Medium Priority)

### Analysis

**Affected Tests**: All OpenFDA integration tests (10 skipped tests)

**Error Patterns**:
```
SKIPPED: FDA API not available: 'async_generator' object has no attribute 'search_predicates'
services.openfda.FDAAPIError: Failed to search adverse events: 'coroutine' object has no attribute...
```

**Root Cause Investigation**:
- The OpenFDA service is returning async generators instead of proper service instances
- Mock setup for FDA API testing is incorrect
- Service instantiation pattern is not compatible with test fixtures
- Missing proper async service method definitions

**Evidence from Service Code**:
The `services/openfda.py` file shows the service class exists but test fixtures are not properly instantiating it, leading to async generator objects being returned instead of service instances.

### Resolution Tasks

- [ ] 4. Fix OpenFDA Service Integration and Mocking
  - Create proper mock OpenFDA service instances for testing instead of async generators
  - Fix service instantiation pattern to return proper service objects with expected methods
  - Implement comprehensive async service testing fixtures with proper mocking
  - Update OpenFDA service class to ensure methods like search_predicates are properly defined and accessible
  - Create test-specific OpenFDA client configuration that doesn't require actual API access
  - Implement proper error handling for service unavailability scenarios
  - Potential root cause: OpenFDA service returning async generators instead of service instances and missing expected methods
  - Potential solution: Implement proper service mocking with all required methods and fix service instantiation
  - Test command: `cd medical-device-regulatory-assistant/backend && poetry run python -m pytest tests/test_openfda_integration.py -v`
  - Code snippet:
    ```python
    # Fix in conftest.py - Add proper OpenFDA service fixture
    @pytest.fixture
    def mock_openfda_service():
        service = OpenFDAService(api_key="test_key")
        with patch.object(service, '_make_request') as mock_request:
            mock_request.return_value = {
                "results": [
                    {
                        "k_number": "K123456",
                        "device_name": "Test Device",
                        "intended_use": "Test use",
                        "product_code": "ABC"
                    }
                ]
            }
            yield service
    
    # Fix service instantiation in tests
    def test_predicate_search(mock_openfda_service):
        results = await mock_openfda_service.search_predicates("test device")
        assert len(results) > 0
        assert results[0].k_number == "K123456"
    ```

## Category 5: Authentication and JWT Token Issues (Medium Priority)

### Analysis

**Affected Tests**: All authentication-related tests

**Error Patterns**:
```
assert 500 == 201  # Expected success, got server error
assert 500 == 401  # Expected unauthorized, got server error
```

**Root Cause Investigation**:
- Authentication middleware is causing server errors instead of proper auth validation
- JWT token generation and validation is not working in test environment
- Mock authentication setup is incomplete or misconfigured
- Authentication service dependencies are not properly mocked

**Evidence from Test Results**:
All authentication tests return 500 status codes regardless of whether tokens are valid, invalid, or missing, indicating a fundamental issue with the authentication middleware in test environments.

### Resolution Tasks

- [ ] 5. Fix Authentication and JWT Token Testing
  - Create proper JWT token generation and validation mocking for test environments
  - Fix authentication middleware configuration to work correctly in test scenarios
  - Implement comprehensive auth test fixtures with valid and invalid token scenarios
  - Update authentication service to handle test environment properly without causing server errors
  - Create mock user authentication that bypasses actual OAuth flow for testing
  - Add proper error handling in authentication middleware to prevent 500 errors
  - Potential root cause: Authentication middleware causing 500 server errors instead of proper auth validation responses
  - Potential solution: Implement test-specific authentication mocking and fix middleware error handling
  - Test command: `cd medical-device-regulatory-assistant/backend && poetry run python -m pytest tests/test_auth_endpoints.py::TestProjectsAuthentication::test_create_project_valid_auth -v`
  - Code snippet:
    ```python
    # Fix in conftest.py - Add auth fixtures
    @pytest.fixture
    def auth_headers():
        token = create_test_jwt_token({
            "sub": "test_user", 
            "email": "test@example.com",
            "name": "Test User"
        })
        return {"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}
    
    @pytest.fixture
    def mock_auth_service():
        with patch('services.auth.get_current_user') as mock_auth:
            mock_auth.return_value = TokenData(
                sub="test_user", 
                email="test@example.com",
                name="Test User"
            )
            yield mock_auth
    
    # Fix authentication middleware error handling
    # Add try-catch blocks to prevent 500 errors
    async def auth_middleware(request, call_next):
        try:
            # Authentication logic
            return await call_next(request)
        except AuthenticationError:
            return JSONResponse(
                status_code=401,
                content={"detail": "Authentication failed"}
            )
    ```

## Category 6: Service Property and Dependency Issues (Low Priority)

### Analysis

**Affected Tests**: Project service tests

**Error Patterns**:
```
AttributeError: property 'db_manager' of 'ProjectService' object has no setter
```

**Root Cause Investigation**:
- Service classes have read-only properties that tests are trying to modify
- Dependency injection pattern is not compatible with test mocking
- Service initialization requires proper database manager injection

### Resolution Tasks

- [ ] 6. Fix Service Property and Dependency Injection Issues
  - Refactor service classes to use proper dependency injection instead of read-only properties
  - Update service initialization to accept database manager injection for testing
  - Create service factory functions that can be easily mocked in test environments
  - Fix property setter issues by implementing proper service configuration patterns
  - Update all service tests to use proper mocking and dependency injection
  - Implement constructor-based dependency injection for all services
  - Potential root cause: Service classes have read-only properties that tests cannot modify and improper dependency injection patterns
  - Potential solution: Implement constructor-based dependency injection and remove read-only property constraints
  - Test command: `cd medical-device-regulatory-assistant/backend && poetry run python -m pytest tests/test_project_service.py -v`
  - Code snippet:
    ```python
    # Fix in services/projects.py
    class ProjectService:
        def __init__(self, db_manager: DatabaseManager = None):
            self._db_manager = db_manager or get_database_manager()
        
        @property
        def db_manager(self):
            return self._db_manager
        
        # Remove read-only constraint, allow injection
        def set_db_manager(self, db_manager: DatabaseManager):
            self._db_manager = db_manager
    
    # Fix in tests - Use dependency injection
    @pytest.fixture
    def project_service(test_db_manager):
        return ProjectService(db_manager=test_db_manager)
    ```

## Category 7: System Environment and Configuration (System Setup Issue)

### Analysis

**Affected Tests**: Health check and system integration tests

**Error Patterns**:
```
assert 500 == 503  # Health check failures
KeyError: 'service'  # Missing configuration
```

**Root Cause Investigation**:
- Missing or incorrect environment variable configuration for testing
- Some services require external dependencies (Redis, etc.) that aren't available in test environment
- Test environment doesn't match production environment constraints

### Resolution Tasks

- [ ] 7. System Environment and Configuration Setup
  - Configure proper test environment variables and settings for all test scenarios
  - Set up test-specific configuration that doesn't require external services like Redis
  - Create comprehensive test environment setup documentation and scripts
  - Implement proper test database seeding and cleanup procedures
  - Configure CI/CD environment to match test requirements and dependencies
  - Add environment validation for test scenarios
  - Potential root cause: Missing or incorrect environment configuration causing service initialization failures
  - Potential solution: Create comprehensive test environment setup with proper configuration management
  - Test command: `cd medical-device-regulatory-assistant/backend && poetry run python -m pytest tests/test_health_check_service.py -v`
  - Code snippet:
    ```python
    # Fix in conftest.py - Add environment setup
    @pytest.fixture(scope="session", autouse=True)
    def setup_test_environment():
        os.environ["TESTING"] = "true"
        os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "sqlite+aiosqlite:///:memory:"
        os.environ["REDIS_URL"] = ""  # Disable Redis for testing
        os.environ["FDA_API_KEY"] = "test_key"
        os.environ["JWT_SECRET"] = "test_secret"
        yield
        # Cleanup environment
        for key in ["TESTING", "DATABASE_URL", "REDIS_URL", "FDA_API_KEY", "JWT_SECRET"]:
            os.environ.pop(key, None)
    
    # Add configuration validation
    def validate_test_environment():
        required_vars = ["TESTING", "DATABASE_URL"]
        missing = [var for var in required_vars if not os.getenv(var)]
        if missing:
            raise EnvironmentError(f"Missing test environment variables: {missing}")
    ```
