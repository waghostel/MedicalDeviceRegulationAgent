- **Environment variable security** for API keys and secrets

### 3. AI Integration Benefits

#### CopilotKit Integration

Already successfully implemented and working well with Next.js:

```typescript
// Seamless AI chat integration
<CopilotProvider>
  <CopilotChat
    instructions="You are a regulatory assistant for medical devices..."
    makeSystemMessage="Focus on FDA 510(k) predicate searches..."
  />
</CopilotProvider>
```

- React-based chat interfaces for regulatory assistance

- **External regulatory databases** with proper error handling
- **Rate limiting and caching** for API efficiency

### 4. Developer Experience & Productivity

#### TypeScript Support

Essential for regulatory software reliability:

```typescript
interface PredicateDevice {
  kNumber: string;
  deviceName: string;
  intendedUse: string;
  productCode: string;
  clearanceDate: string;
  confidenceScore: number;
  comparisonData: ComparisonMatrix;
}
```

- **Type safety** for medical device data models
- **Better IDE support** for complex regulatory workflows
- **Reduced runtime errors** in production environments
- **Self-documenting code** for regulatory compliance

#### Modern Tooling Ecosystem

Already leveraging best-in-class tools:

- **Tailwind CSS** for consistent, professional UI
- **Shadcn UI** for accessible, regulatory-appropriate components
- **Jest/Playwright** for comprehensive testing coverage
- **ESLint/Prettier** for code quality and consistency

### 5. Scalability for MVP Growth

#### Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

Perfect for regulatory content management:

```typescript
// Cache FDA guidance documents with automatic updates
export const revalidate = 3600; // Revalidate every hour

export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const guidanceDocs = await fetchFDAGuidanceDocuments();
  return guidanceDocs.map((doc) => ({ id: doc.id }));
}
```

- **Cache FDA guidance documents** for fast access
- **Update predicate search results** efficiently
- **Handle regulatory updates** without full rebuilds
- **Optimize performance** for document-heavy workflows

#### Edge Functions

Future-ready capabilities for:

- **Global regulatory compliance** across different markets
- **Low-latency predicate searches** for better user experience
- **Distributed regulatory data processing** for scalability
- **Geographic data compliance** (GDPR, etc.)

### 6. Evidence from Current Implementation

The existing codebase demonstrates Next.js delivering excellent results:

```typescript
// Sophisticated provider architecture for regulatory context
export default async function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const session = await getServerSession(authOptions);

  return (
    <html lang="en" suppressHydrationWarning>
      <body className={`${geistSans.variable} ${geistMono.variable} antialiased`}>
        <SessionProvider session={session}>
          <ProjectContextProvider>
            <WebSocketProvider>
              {children}
              <Toaster />
            </WebSocketProvider>
          </ProjectContextProvider>
        </SessionProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

**Key Implementation Strengths:**

- Clean separation of concerns with provider pattern
- Proper state management for regulatory projects
- Real-time capabilities for agent interactions
- Professional UI with accessibility considerations

### 7. Alternative Technology Considerations

#### Why Not Pure React SPA?

- **SEO Requirements**: Regulatory content needs search engine visibility
- **Security Concerns**: Server-side authentication is more secure for sensitive data

- **Compliance**: Server-side logging easier for audit trails

#### Why Not Separate Frontend/Backend?

- **Complexity Overhead**: Increases deployment and maintenance complexity for MVP
- **Development Velocity**: Slower development cycle for rapid MVP iteration
- **Audit Trail Challenges**: Harder to maintain consistent logging across services
- **Authentication Complexity**: More complex auth flow across separate services

### 8. Regulatory-Specific Benefits
