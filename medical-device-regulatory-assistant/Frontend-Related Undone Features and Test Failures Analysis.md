Frontend-Related Undone Features and Test Failures Analysis
Based on the test execution results and examination of the frontend codebase, here are the identified issues:

ERRORS (Test Failures)
[ ] [Error] Integration Test Failures - MSW Mock Server Setup Issues

Root cause: Complex MSW (Mock Service Worker) integration setup causing TypeScript/JavaScript import conflicts in Jest configuration
Proposed action: Simplify MSW setup by removing complex integration setup files and using direct mocking in individual test files

[ ] [Error] Real-time Features WebSocket Connection Management

Root cause: WebSocket mock implementations not properly simulating connection states and error scenarios
Proposed action: Implement proper WebSocket mocking with state management for connection, disconnection, and error scenarios

[ ] [Error] Agent Typing Indicators Not Displaying

Root cause: Missing implementation of typing indicator components and state management
Proposed action: Create typing indicator components and integrate with WebSocket message handling

[ ] [Error] Project Form Toast Notifications Not Triggering

Root cause: Mock toast functions not being called due to missing error handling integration
Proposed action: Fix toast notification integration in ProjectForm component and ensure proper error handling

[ ] [Error] Device Type Selection Component Import Issues

Root cause: Undefined component imports causing "Element type is invalid" errors
Proposed action: Fix component imports and ensure all UI components are properly exported

[ ] [Error] Keyboard Navigation Focus Management

Root cause: Focus management not working correctly in form components
Proposed action: Implement proper focus management and keyboard navigation in form components

[ ] [Error] Regulatory Analysis Button Text Mismatch

Root cause: Test expectations don't match actual button text in regulatory analysis components
Proposed action: Update test expectations to match actual UI text or fix UI text to match requirements

[ ] [Error] Project Status Data Inconsistency

Root cause: Mock data status values not matching expected values in tests
Proposed action: Standardize mock data to ensure consistent status values across tests

[ ] [Error] Concurrent User Interaction Conflict Resolution

Root cause: Missing implementation of conflict detection and resolution mechanisms
Proposed action: Implement conflict detection UI components and resolution workflows

[ ] [Error] Connection Recovery Exponential Backoff

Root cause: Connection recovery logic not properly implementing exponential backoff timing
Proposed action: Fix connection recovery implementation with proper exponential backoff algorithm
FEATURES (Missing Implementations)

[ ] [Feature] Agent Response Streaming Interface

Why need to implement this: Provides better user experience with live streaming of AI agent responses
Proposed steps to implement:
Create streaming response UI components with typing indicators
Implement WebSocket message handling for streaming data
Add interruption and recovery mechanisms for streaming
Integrate with existing agent workflow components

[ ] [Feature] Multi-user Typing Indicators

Why need to implement this: Essential for collaborative features and user awareness
Proposed steps to implement:
Create typing indicator UI components
Implement user identification and typing state management
Add WebSocket integration for broadcasting typing status
Handle multiple simultaneous users typing

[ ] [Feature] Advanced Error Recovery Mechanisms

Why need to implement this: Improves application resilience and user experience during network issues
Proposed steps to implement:
Implement comprehensive error boundary components
Add retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
Create offline functionality detection and handling
Add user-friendly error messages and recovery options

[ ] [Feature] Contextual Toast Notification System

Why need to implement this: Provides proper user feedback for all application actions
Proposed steps to implement:
Complete toast notification integration in all components
Add different toast types (success, error, warning, info)
Implement toast queuing and management
Add accessibility features for toast notifications

[ ] [Feature] Enhanced Form Validation and User Experience

Why need to implement this: Ensures data quality and provides better user guidance
Proposed steps to implement:
Complete form validation logic for all fields
Add real-time validation feedback
Implement proper error message display
Add form auto-save functionality

[ ] [Feature] Accessibility Compliance Enhancements

Why need to implement this: Required for regulatory compliance and inclusive design
Proposed steps to implement:
Complete keyboard navigation implementation
Add proper ARIA labels and descriptions
Implement screen reader compatibility
Add high contrast mode support

[ ] [Feature] Performance Optimization Features

Why need to implement this: Ensures application scalability and good user experience
Proposed steps to implement:
Implement virtual scrolling for large data sets
Add lazy loading for components and data
Optimize bundle size and loading performance
Add performance monitoring and metrics

[ ] [Feature] Mobile Responsive Design Completion

Why need to implement this: Ensures application works across all device types
Proposed steps to implement:
Complete responsive design for all components
Add touch-friendly interactions
Optimize layouts for mobile viewports
Test and fix mobile-specific issues

[ ] [Feature] Advanced Search and Filter Functionality

Why need to implement this: Improves user productivity and data discovery
Proposed steps to implement:
Implement advanced search UI components
Add filter combinations and saved searches
Integrate with backend search APIs
Add search result highlighting and pagination
This analysis shows that while the core validation tests are passing (like the Task 8.4 core validation), there are significant gaps in the integration tests, real-time features, and user experience components that need to be addressed for a production-ready application.
