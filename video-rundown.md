| **0:00 – 0:15 (15s)** | **Introduction**                             | • Who you are / Team name <br> • Name of the project <br> • Category you’re submitting (e.g. Productivity & Workflow / Games / Educational / Wildcard)                                                                                                                                     | Keep it sharp. First impression matters. State category so judges immediately know where you fit.                                                                           |
| **0:15 – 0:45 (30s)** | **Problem / Motivation**                     | • What problem you saw (pain point) <br> • Why it matters — who is affected <br> • Why existing solutions are lacking (if applicable)                                                                                                                                                      | Relate this to Kiro’s strengths: using spec-driven dev, agent hooks, etc. Make the need clear.                                                                              |
| **0:45 – 1:30 (45s)** | **Solution / What You Built**                | • Describe your project: what it does, its main features <br> • Platform / environment (web? desktop? mobile?) <br> • What makes it unique or creative <br> • Demonstrate live usage: show the app running, key flows in action                                                            | Emphasize how Kiro was used. E.g.: **spec → code**, agent hooks, workflow automation. Visuals/screenshots or screen recording are crucial.                                  |
| **1:30 – 2:15 (45s)** | **How Kiro Helped & Implementation Details** | • Show your process: how you structured specs, how you talked to Kiro to generate code <br> • If applicable: what third-party APIs / SDKs you used <br> • Any challenges you overcame, and how Kiro played a role in solving them <br> • Show the parts of code generation, hook use, etc. | Be honest about limitations. If something didn’t go as planned, that’s OK; it may show maturity. But be sure you satisfy the rules: that the video shows how Kiro was used. |
| **2:15 – 2:45 (30s)** | **Impact, Value, & Future Plans**            | • What impact the tool has / whom it helps <br> • Why it’s useful: usability, accessibility, scalability, etc. <br> • Possible future enhancements <br> • If relevant: what you’d do beyond hackathon time                                                                                 | Align with judging criteria: *Potential Value*, *Quality of Idea*, *Implementation*.                                                                                        |
| **2:45 – 3:00 (15s)** | **Conclusion & Call to Action**              | • Quick summary: restate problem + your solution <br> • Thank the judges, invite questions <br> • Provide link to code repo, where to try demo (if applicable)                                                                                                                             | Make sure contact / repository visibility is clear. Leave a memorable final sentence.                                                                                       |
