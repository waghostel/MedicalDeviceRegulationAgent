# Medical Device Regulatory Assistant - Frontend Investigation Report

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the Next.js frontend application for the Medical Device Regulatory Assistant, an AI-powered regulatory pathway discovery platform for medical device companies.

## System Overview

The Medical Device Regulatory Assistant is a specialized platform designed to streamline the regulatory process for medical device companies, with an initial focus on the US FDA market and 510(k) predicate search workflows. The frontend is built using Next.js 15.5.2 with React 19.1.0, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

The user's journey begins with secure authentication via Google OAuth, managed by NextAuth.js. Once authenticated, the application wraps the core pages with a `SessionProvider` for session state and a `ProjectContextProvider` to manage project-specific data. The user lands on the **Home Dashboard**, which serves as the main entry point. From here, they can navigate to the **Projects Hub** to view and manage their regulatory projects. Selecting a specific project leads to the **Project Detail** page, which is the central hub for a single project's workflow. This detail page provides access to the **Agent Workflow** for AI-powered analysis, the **Document Editor** for creating regulatory documents, and the **Audit Log** for tracking compliance. These core features interact with the backend services through a dedicated API layer, ensuring a clear separation between the frontend and the core business logic.

**Architecture Description:**

- **Authentication Layer**: Google OAuth 2.0 integration using NextAuth.js for secure user authentication
- **Context Providers**: SessionProvider manages authentication state, ProjectContextProvider handles project-specific data
- **Core Pages**: Main application functionality focused on regulatory workflow management
- **API Integration**: Next.js API routes connecting to FastAPI backend for AI-powered regulatory analysis
- **Demo Environment**: Testing and development utilities for component validation
