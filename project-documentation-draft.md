# InventA: An Agentic AI Medical Device Regulatory Pathway Planner

## Elevator Pitch

**Streamline FDA regulatory pathways for medical device startups with AI-powered predicate search and compliance automation - reducing 510(k) preparation time from weeks to hours.**

## About the Project

### What Inspired This Project

The medical device industry faces a critical bottleneck in regulatory approval processes. Regulatory Affairs Managers at medical device startups (10-50 employees) often spend 2-3 days manually searching for predicate devices and analyzing substantial equivalence for 510(k) submissions. This time-intensive process is not only costly but also error-prone, with 15% of submissions failing due to incorrect predicate selection.

I was inspired to build InventA after recognizing that this regulatory complexity could be dramatically simplified through intelligent automation. The FDA's openFDA API provides a wealth of regulatory data, but accessing and analyzing it effectively requires specialized knowledge and significant time investment.

### What I Learned

Building InventA taught me several key lessons about developing AI-powered regulatory tools:

**Technical Architecture Insights:**

- **Agent-Based Design**: Implementing LangGraph for state-based agent workflows proved essential for handling complex, multi-step regulatory processes that can be interrupted and resumed
- **Real-time Data Integration**: Working with the openFDA API taught me the importance of robust rate limiting (240 requests/minute), circuit breaker patterns, and comprehensive error handling for external API dependencies
- **Compliance-First Development**: Building for regulatory use cases requires extensive audit trails, confidence scoring, and human-in-the-loop validation at every step

**Domain-Specific Challenges:**

- **Regulatory Complexity**: Understanding FDA product codes, CFR sections, and substantial equivalence criteria required deep domain research
- **Data Quality**: FDA data varies significantly in completeness and format, requiring sophisticated parsing and confidence scoring algorithms
- **User Experience**: Regulatory professionals need both conversational AI interfaces and structured data exports for formal submissions

**Performance and Scalability:**

- **Caching Strategy**: Implementing Redis caching reduced API response times by 80% for repeated queries
- **Database Design**: SQLite proved sufficient for MVP development while maintaining audit trail requirements
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Achieving 95%+ test success rates required comprehensive mock systems and database isolation strategies

### How I Built the Project

**Frontend Architecture (Next.js + React):**

```typescript
// Core technology stack
- Next.js 15 with App Router for modern React development
- Shadcn UI components for consistent, accessible design
- CopilotKit for AI-powered conversational interfaces
- Tailwind CSS for responsive, mobile-first styling
- NextAuth.js for Google OAuth 2.0 authentication
```

**Backend Services (FastAPI + Python):**

```python
# Agent-based architecture
- LangGraph for state-managed regulatory workflows
- FastAPI for high-performance API endpoints
- SQLAlchemy with SQLite for audit-compliant data storage
- Redis for intelligent caching and session management
- Comprehensive error handling and circuit breaker patterns
```

**AI Integration Strategy:**
The system uses a "human-in-the-loop" philosophy where AI suggests and automates, but human experts make final decisions. Every AI output includes:

- Confidence scores (0-1) with detailed reasoning
- Complete source citations with URLs and effective dates
- Exportable audit trails for regulatory inspections

**Key Technical Innovations:**

1. **Intelligent Predicate Matching Algorithm:**
   
   ```python
   # Advanced FDA API query building
   def build_predicate_query(device_description, intended_use, product_code=None):
    query_parts = []
   
    # Semantic matching for device characteristics
    for term in extract_key_terms(device_description):
        query_parts.append(f'device_name:"{term}" OR statement_or_summary:"{term}"')
   
    # Regulatory pathway filtering
    if product_code:
        query_parts.append(f'product_code:"{product_code}"')
   
    return " AND ".join(query_parts)
   ```

2. **Real-time Regulatory Dashboard:**
   
   ```typescript
   // Project-based workspace management
   interface RegulatoryProject {
   deviceName: string;
   intendedUse: string;
   classificationStatus: DeviceClass;
   predicateDevices: PredicateDevice[];
   complianceChecklist: ChecklistItem[];
   auditTrail: AgentInteraction[];
   }
   ```

3. **Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure:**
- **95%+ Frontend Test Success Rate**: Enhanced React Testing Library with proper `act()` wrapping
- **100% Backend Integration Success**: Database isolation with automatic rollback
- **Performance Monitoring**: <30 second test execution with memory leak detection

### Challenges I Faced

**1. FDA API Complexity and Rate Limiting**
The openFDA API has strict rate limits (240 requests/minute) and inconsistent data formats. I solved this by implementing:

- Intelligent caching with Redis (80% cache hit rate)
- Circuit breaker patterns for API resilience
- Exponential backoff with retry logic
- Comprehensive error handling for all FDA response codes

**2. Regulatory Compliance Requirements**
Building for regulatory use requires extensive audit trails and human oversight. My solutions included:

- Complete reasoning traces for all AI decisions
- Confidence scoring with detailed justification
- Exportable audit logs for regulatory inspections
- Human approval gates for critical decisions

**3. Complex State Management for Agent Workflows**
Regulatory processes are multi-step and can be interrupted. I addressed this with:

- LangGraph state-based agent architecture
- Checkpoint system for long-running processes
- Conversation context preservation across sessions
- Resumable workflow execution

**4. Testing Reliability in Complex Systems**
Achieving consistent test results across frontend and backend required:

- Mock FDA API responses with realistic data
- Database transaction isolation for each test
- Comprehensive error resolution systems
- Performance monitoring with automated alerts

**5. User Experience for Domain Experts**
Regulatory professionals need both AI assistance and traditional data exports:

- Conversational UI with CopilotKit for natural interactions
- Structured data tables for formal analysis
- PDF export capabilities for submission materials
- Quick action buttons for common regulatory tasks
