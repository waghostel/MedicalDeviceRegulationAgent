# MedevAI: Video Transcript (3 Minutes)

## 0:00 – 0:15 (15s) | Introduction

Hi, I'm presenting **MedevAI** - an Agentic Medical Device Regulatory Pathway Planner. We're submitting in the **Productivity & Workflow** category. MedevAI transforms the complex FDA medical device approval process into a streamlined, AI-powered workflow that reduces 510(k) preparation time from weeks to hours.

## 0:15 – 0:45 (30s) | Problem & Motivation

Medical device companies face a critical bottleneck: finding predicate devices for FDA 510(k) submissions. This manual process takes regulatory teams 2-3 days of research, and mistakes contribute to a 15% submission failure rate. Existing solutions are fragmented - regulatory professionals juggle multiple databases, guidance documents, and spreadsheets without intelligent integration. 

The FDA's open data is a treasure trove, but it remains locked for most companies. Small medical device startups lose precious time and resources on this error-prone search, delaying life-saving innovations from reaching patients.

## 0:45 – 1:30 (45s) | Solution & What We Built

MedevAI is an intelligent regulatory assistant powered by advanced AI agents. Here's what makes it unique:

**[Screen: Dashboard showing device classification]**
First, it automatically classifies your device and determines the regulatory pathway - Class I, II, or III with appropriate FDA product codes.

**[Screen: Predicate search results with confidence scores]**
Then, our semantic search engine finds the most suitable predicate devices from the FDA database, ranking them by substantial equivalence potential with confidence scores.

**[Screen: Side-by-side comparison table]**
It generates detailed comparison tables highlighting similarities and differences, plus identifies required testing for any gaps.

**[Screen: Conversational AI interface]**
All through an intuitive conversational interface that maintains complete audit trails for regulatory compliance. The system provides real-time FDA data integration while ensuring every AI decision is explainable and traceable.

## 1:30 – 2:15 (45s) | How Kiro Helped & Implementation

Kiro was instrumental in building this entire system from the ground up. We used a **spec-driven development approach** - starting with comprehensive steering documents that defined regulatory requirements, then letting Kiro autonomously implement complex features.

**[Screen: Code generation in action]**
Kiro generated our full-stack architecture: React/Next.js frontend with CopilotKit for conversational AI, FastAPI backend with LangGraph agents for regulatory workflows, and intelligent FDA API integration with semantic analysis.

**[Screen: Agent hooks in action]**
We leveraged **agent hooks** to automate our development workflow - creating tasks, analyzing errors, and generating comprehensive test reports. This transformed our process from reactive coding to proactive, autonomous execution.

The most impressive aspect was Kiro's ability to understand regulatory domain expertise - implementing substantial equivalence analysis, audit trail requirements, and compliance standards without extensive guidance.

## 2:15 – 2:45 (30s) | Impact & Future Plans

MedevAI delivers a **90% time reduction** - from 2-3 days to under 2 hours for predicate identification. This directly impacts patient care by accelerating medical device innovation.

Our regulatory-grade AI architecture with complete audit trails meets FDA inspection standards, while the semantic search dramatically improves match quality over keyword-based systems.

**Future plans include**: expanding to global regulatory frameworks like EU MDR, adding predictive analytics for submission success rates, and building integrations with QMS platforms to create a complete regulatory ecosystem.

## 2:45 – 3:00 (15s) | Conclusion & Call to Action

MedevAI transforms regulatory complexity into streamlined intelligence, empowering medical device innovators to focus on building the future of healthcare while AI clears the regulatory path.

Thank you for your time. You can explore our code repository and try the demo - we're excited to answer any questions about how we're revolutionizing medical device regulatory workflows with AI.
