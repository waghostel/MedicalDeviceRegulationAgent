### Test Verification Report

**Test Command:** `pnpm test:unit src/components/ui/__tests__/toast-integration.unit.test.tsx`

**Summary of Results:**

The test suite for `toast-integration.unit.test.tsx` passed successfully. However, the test run triggered a cascade of failures in other unit tests, indicating that the recent changes to the toast notification system have had a wide-ranging impact on the application's component rendering and behavior during tests.

**Root Cause Analysis:**

The primary root cause of the widespread failures appears to be related to the new `useToast` hook and its interaction with the React testing environment. The key issues identified are:

1. **Asynchronous State Updates Not Wrapped in `act()`:** The most frequent error is `An update to TestComponent inside a test was not wrapped in act(...)`. This error originates in the `use-toast.ts` hook, specifically within the `dispatch` function that updates the toast state. When state updates are not wrapped in `act()`, React cannot properly manage the component lifecycle during tests, leading to unpredictable rendering and assertion failures.

2. **Component Rendering Failures:** Many tests for components that use the new toast system are failing because they are unable to find expected elements in the rendered output (e.g., `Unable to find an element by: [data-testid="toast-title"]`). This is a direct consequence of the `act()` issue, as the components are not rendering correctly before the test assertions are made.

3. **Syntax Error in `project-list.tsx`:** A syntax error (`Unexpected token, expected ","`) was found in `src/components/projects/project-list.tsx`, which is preventing cÃ¡i test suite from running at all.

4. **Other Failures:** A number of other tests are failing with similar element-not-found errors. These are likely due to the same root causes, as the components under test may directly or indirectly depend on the toast system or other components that are failing to render correctly.

**Potential Solutions:**

1. **Wrap State Updates in `act()`:** The most critical fix is to ensure that all state updates within the `useToast` hook and the related tests are wrapped in the `act()` utility from `@testing-library/react`. This will ensure that React has processed all state changes and re-renders before any assertions are made.

   - **File to Modify:** `src/hooks/__tests__/use-toast.unit.test.ts`
   - **Example:**

     ```typescript
     // Before
     fireEvent.click(button);
     expect(screen.getByText("Success")).toBeInTheDocument();

     // After
     act(() => {
       fireEvent.click(button);
     });
     expect(screen.getByText("Success")).toBeInTheDocument();
     ```

2. **Fix Syntax Error:** The syntax error in `src/components/projects/project-list.tsx` needs to be corrected. Based on the error message, it is likely a missing comma or an extra JSX comment that is causing the issue.

   - **File to Modify:** `src/components/projects/project-list.tsx` at line 313.

3. **Review Component Rendering:** After addressing the `act()` and syntax issues, the `Toast` and `Toaster` components should be reviewed to ensure they are rendering as expected. The `data-testid` attributes should be verified to match what the tests are looking for.

   - **Files to Review:**
     - `src/components/ui/toast.tsx`
     - `src/components/ui/toaster.tsx`

By addressing these core issues, it is highly likely that the majority of the failing tests will be resolved.
